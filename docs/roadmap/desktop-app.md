# Desktop App (Tauri)

Status: Windows-first v0 implementation complete; signed release validation
pending.

The owning behavior contract is
[`topics/desktop-v0.md`](../../topics/desktop-v0.md). Tactical 067 records the
accepted direction, compatibility audit, implementation slices, and release
matrix:
[`docs/tactical/067-v0-desktop-baseline.md`](../tactical/067-v0-desktop-baseline.md).

## Implemented V0

The desktop release is one atomic unit:

```text
Yep Anywhere Desktop
├─ Tauri shell and tray
├─ private, hash-verified Bun runtime
├─ commit-matched server/client production resource
└─ runtime manifest with versions and hashes
```

First launch starts that bundled resource directly. It does not install YA,
Bun, Claude, Codex, package managers, or provider credentials. Claude and
Codex remain externally managed; when neither application is detected the
dashboard opens normally with a dismissible warning and official links.

The dashboard remains on random-port loopback HTTP for v0. Native Rust passes
a master secret to the paired server through stdin, mints a short-lived
single-use navigation code, and the server exchanges it for a host-only
HttpOnly Strict cookie. Reload no longer depends on a bearer token retained by
renderer JavaScript.

Windows owns the bundled server and descendants with a kill-on-close Job
Object. The app provides a tray, stable/development runtime identification,
bounded server output, a startup diagnostic fallback, restart/quit controls,
and the existing prompted Tauri updater.

## Windows Distribution

The signed per-user NSIS executable is the only Windows download and supports
`/S` for quiet installation without elevation. Windows releases do not publish
an MSI or another installer that requires administrator access.

Release tags require the Tauri updater signing key and complete Windows
code-signing credentials. CI validates the Windows updater entries, signature,
and live artifact URLs before publishing.

## Deferred

- Installing, updating, or authenticating Claude/Codex.
- Unattended background update installation.
- Automatic rollback or downgrade.
- General Linux distribution polish.
- Replacing loopback HTTP with a native invoke/Channel application transport.

The preferred later transport keeps the bundled UI on the Tauri origin and
uses framed private native/server IPC, enabling loopback HTTP to be disabled
when browser, mobile, and remote access are not needed.
