## After Editing Code

After editing TypeScript or other source files, verify your changes compile
and pass `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm typecheck` (no emit), and
`pnpm test`. For UI changes, run the relevant focused browser checks. The full
client E2E suite remains a CI gate; run it locally when the affected browser
scope cannot be bounded reliably. [E2E testing](../../topics/e2e-testing.md)
owns the decision to add a browser case, choose a cheaper test level, and
measure its cost and reliability. [UI testing](../../topics/ui-testing.md)
owns visual QA and captures.

For site changes (marketing pages in `site/`):

```bash
cd site && npm run build   # Astro check + build (or: pnpm site:build from root)
```

Fix any errors before considering the task complete.

Root `pnpm typecheck` includes `pnpm e2e:typecheck`, which checks all client
Playwright specs, configurations and support modules through
`packages/client/tsconfig.e2e.json`. Keep fixture and startup changes in that
strict gate; Playwright strips types without checking them.

The general CI unit-test job runs `pnpm test`. Android unit, lint, build, and
instrumentation coverage belongs to the dedicated Android App workflow so its
Gradle work does not contend with the JavaScript workspace test processes.
Android JVM unit-test tasks have a five-minute task timeout and emit per-test
lifecycle output so a stalled worker fails with attributable evidence.

On a dedicated, authorized Android device, `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/android
test:live` installs the minified Debug probe and exercises owned direct and local
relay fixtures. Set `YA_NATIVE_PUBLIC_RELAY_LIVE=1` for the separate public TLS
relay check: it registers a uniquely named disposable server, starts native
pairing from Android's Main dispatcher, then verifies the bundled WebView,
streaming, upload and sequential typing. The runner removes its port forwards
and server afterward. Set `ANDROID_SERIAL` when more than one device is attached.
The WebView probe also checks native tabs, internal/external links, warm launcher
resume, draft/scroll identity, rotation and cold route restoration. Add
`YA_NATIVE_NETWORK_LIFECYCLE=1` on an authorized phone to disable both Wi-Fi and
mobile data during warm resume; the probe restores each radio's original state
in teardown. Its tab records and selected profile are restored after the run.
These instrumentation probes preserve extra shared test APIs; separately verify
the actual Release login form before uploading a store bundle. A background
instrumentation caller or plaintext fixture cannot prove UI-initiated TLS login.
The typing probe taps the WebView editor through Android accessibility and
requires window focus, an active input connection and stable viewport before
injecting sequential hardware keys. Input-readiness failure must fail setup,
including on emulators; it must never continue into a partial typing sample.
Live fixture hosts have unique display names so a previous interrupted run
cannot redirect a later host-picker tap to a stopped server. On UI failure,
the probe captures the screen, accessibility hierarchy and window/power state
before teardown. The live runner retains these under
`packages/android/app/build/reports/native-live/` for the existing CI artifact
upload. These captures use the owned fixtures; inspect any local device
captures before sharing them. Hosted run `37219989321` established that a
Pixel Launcher ANR dialog was hiding an otherwise connected YA page from
accessibility. CI compiles its minified probe APKs before starting the emulator,
then uses the same cleartext-fixture/minification properties for ordinary and
live instrumentation. This avoids rebuilding/shrinking a different variant
beside the running emulator. Release network policy remains unchanged.
The UI probes can close that exact
system-owned Pixel Launcher dialog once per test, on emulators only, and retain
its evidence. They never dismiss YA ANRs or relax input-readiness/latency gates.
Link probes resolve the accessible name from either WebView text or content
description, then perform real taps/long presses. Hosted run `37223303403`
exposed the external anchor only as a content description; the external VIEW
intent, unchanged document identity and tab count remain required assertions.

Captured provider regressions run offline in the normal server suite:
`pnpm --dir packages/server exec vitest run test/captured-provider.test.ts`.
The [corpus README](../../packages/server/test/fixtures/captured/README.md)
owns the capture/import recipe, coverage limits, and manifest format. These
tests use production readers/adapters and require no provider credentials or
private histories. Root typechecking includes their helpers and importer.

Environment-dependent subprocess tests must control both the child environment
and relevant process descriptors. In particular, Bash `BASH_ENV` probes use
ignored stdin rather than inheriting a test runner's socket-backed stdin. See
[subprocess environment boundaries](../../topics/subprocess-environment.md) for the
runtime and hermetic-test contract.

Full server-app tests import `test/setup/create-app.ts`, rather than the
production constructor directly. The wrapper gives each app its own storage
under the test file's hermetic data root, as well as empty provider histories.
The production constructor reads its `dataDir` option, not `YEP_DATA_DIR`;
setting the environment alone does not isolate these fixtures. Pass an
explicit `dataDir` only when the test needs an owned persisted profile, such
as a restart or shared-storage scenario. Dispose app services before removing
their fixture directories. The wrapper drains all registered app services at file teardown before removing
the file's storage root, including supervisor maintenance and artifact readiness
writes. Repeated explicit app disposal joins the same cleanup promise.
Restore fake timers before leaving a test that admits asynchronous maintenance
work, so teardown can drain its promises rather than wait on a frozen clock.
The wrapper injects an offline latest-version lookup. Browser server processes
use a fixture preload that supplies the update endpoint's real 204 no-update
response while forwarding other HTTP traffic. Version-route contract tests own
their explicit update responses; general tests never require public update
service availability. Client unit setup clears local/session storage before
invalidating preference caches, so earlier cases cannot choose later defaults.

## Native App CI Cadence

Main CI and Server Runtime And SQLite still run on every pull request and
`main` push. Native application workflows use matching path filters for both
events: platform code, tests, resources, manifests and build scripts trigger
their platform immediately. Shared Rust mobile-core changes trigger both
mobile apps. Native web-host adapter, crypto and binary-framing changes also
retain immediate Android/iOS coverage.

Ordinary web UI, server, shared-code and root lockfile changes do not trigger
native application builds by themselves. Android runs the full build and
WebView instrumentation workflow daily at 04:17 UTC; iOS runs its full Rust,
simulator and unsigned-device workflow at 04:47 UTC. Both scheduled runs check
the current default-branch source, including bundled web changes. Push and
scheduled Android runs verify without publishing. An explicit manual main
run with `publish_internal=true` can publish its verified bundled AAB after
[delivery setup](../distribution/mobile/README.md#android-ci-internal-delivery).
Superseded Android verification runs on the same ref are cancelled; explicit
release runs use a separate group and finish even if new pushes arrive.
iOS still does not publish store releases. GitHub may delay scheduled starts.

Desktop retains its existing 02:37 UTC Nightly Desktop release, which selects
verified main source and skips unchanged packaged inputs. Its per-change
workflow covers the desktop package, packaging inputs and scripts, dependency
manifests for bundled packages, patches and workflow changes. Desktop release
tags and reusable release calls retain full packaging regardless of paths.

All three native workflows support manual dispatch for targeted acceptance or
release preparation. Native package Markdown-only changes do not start builds.
The workflow path lists are authoritative; before a release, obtain passing
platform acceptance for the source being released even when its changes only
received scheduled coverage.

## Cross-Platform Behavior And Tests

Treat Linux, macOS, and Windows as supported development targets. Code and
tests must not assume that the current host's filesystem, descriptor, process,
or shell behavior is portable. Pay particular attention to path syntax and
case handling, symlinks, `/proc` and `/dev/fd`, permissions and file locking,
signals and process trees, executable discovery, temporary directories, and
shell availability.

For every OS-sensitive change, either use portable APIs and cover all three
platforms, or make the narrower capability explicit: document it, gate native
tests by platform or capability, and test the supported fallback on the other
platforms. Passing on one contributor's OS is not sufficient evidence. When
other-OS validation is unavailable, state that limitation in the handoff.
Never weaken a security boundary merely to make another platform pass.

## Device Control Testing

Use the Android emulator only when testing the device-control/device-bridge feature. Check with `source ~/.profile && adb devices` and deploy/test on the emulator for changes that touch device streaming, `/api/devices`, `deviceBridge`, or `packages/device-bridge`. For general client, server, web UI, provider, relay, or rendering changes, do not require emulator testing.

## ChromeOS Debugging

For Chromebook testing and debugging (screenshots, input, diagnostics), use the chromeos-testbed CLI — NOT the browser control skill (which is for local headless Chromium).

```bash
~/code/chromeos-testbed/bin/chromeos screenshot              # saves screenshot, prints path
~/code/chromeos-testbed/bin/chromeos screenshot output.png   # saves to output.png
~/code/chromeos-testbed/bin/chromeos help                    # full command list
```

Requires SSH access to `chromeroot`. See `~/code/chromeos-testbed/CLAUDE.md` for details.
