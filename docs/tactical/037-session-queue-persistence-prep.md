Latest update:

- 2026-06-30: Read-only project-level recovered queue overview implemented
  locally. The global Project Queue response now includes
  `recoveredSessionQueues`, populated from persisted
  `paused-after-restart` patient entries and refreshed on durable session queue
  changes. The Projects page renders those entries above Project Queue items,
  grouped by session with a link to the owning session; resume/delete controls
  remain session-local for this slice.
- 2026-06-30: Project Queue promotion now treats recovered patient queues as
  project-busy. The shared project-idle predicate can include persisted
  `paused-after-restart` patient entries, and the Project Queue scheduler wires
  that count in when deciding whether to promote project-level work. Durable
  session queue persistence changes also wake the scheduler, so deleting or
  resuming the preserved per-session head lets queued project work promote once
  the project is otherwise idle.
- 2026-06-30: Live patient queue preservation at the safe-restart boundary
  implemented locally. `SafeRestartService` now runs a preserved-work
  preparation hook before deciding whether queued-message blockers remain. The
  Supervisor hook is deliberately conservative: it only converts live patient
  queue entries after Project Queue dispatch has already been paused and there
  are no active sessions, no supervisor worker queue, no direct provider queue,
  and no short-term deferred queue entries. At that point each live patient
  entry is flushed through the existing patient queue persistence chain, marked
  `paused-after-restart`, removed from the live `Process.deferredQueue`, and
  reported as preserved restart work. If anything volatile remains, safe
  restart still waits.
- 2026-06-30: Safe-restart preserved queue reporting implemented locally.
  The session queue persistence service now emits an internal change event
  after successful disk mutations, and `SafeRestartService` can report preserved
  work separately from drain blockers. In manual/dev restart mode, recovered
  `paused-after-restart` patient entries appear in safe-restart state as
  `recovered-session-queue` preserved work and are appended to the reload
  banner's scheduled restart status. This count does not make the banner unsafe
  by itself and does not block restart. Active sessions plus live in-memory
  per-session queues still provide the blocking drain status.
- 2026-06-30: Head recovered patient queue resume implemented locally.
  Restart-paused patient entries now render with `Resume` and `Delete` actions.
  Resume is intentionally head-only per session: the server rejects non-oldest
  recovered entries, and also rejects resume when a live deferred queue already
  has backlog that would put older recovered work behind newer live work. A
  successful resume reactivates/attaches the session without sending a turn,
  re-enters the message through `Process.deferMessage` as patient work, and
  preserves the durable queue id plus original queued timestamp by upserting the
  record from `paused-after-restart` back to `queued`. Remaining recovered
  entries are included with live queue summaries so the next paused item is
  still visible after the session has been reactivated.
- 2026-06-30: Paused recovery display/delete implemented locally. Shared
  session queue summary DTOs now include optional durable `id`, `kind`, and
  `status` fields. Session detail and metadata responses report recovered
  `paused-after-restart` patient entries when no live process owns the queue,
  and the session page mirrors those entries from REST load/metadata refresh.
  Recovered chips render as `Paused after restart` and delete through a durable
  queue-id endpoint that removes the persisted item. This chunk still does not
  resume recovered entries or show a project-level recovered-queue summary.
- 2026-06-30: Recovery surface plan agreed. The paused/recovered state should
  live on the durable queue envelope, not inside the provider-bound
  `UserMessage`. The first recovery chunk should expose
  `paused-after-restart` patient entries as server-reported queue summary data
  on session load/metadata, render them as paused session queue chips, and allow
  deletion by durable queue id. Explicit resume of individual entries or all
  project recovered entries is a follow-up because it needs process attach/
  recreate semantics and queue-order dispatch rules.
- 2026-06-30: Patient live persistence wiring implemented locally.
  `SessionQueuePersistenceService` is initialized at server startup and passed
  through `Supervisor` into each `Process`. `Process.deferMessage` now writes
  only real patient entries (`deliveryIntent: "patient"` on providers where
  patient semantics apply) to disk, using a durable server-owned queue id stored
  on the in-memory queue entry. Patient cancel, drain/interrupt, and verified
  idle promotion delete the persisted record. Short-term deferred entries and
  direct `MessageQueue` entries are intentionally not written. Startup-loaded
  paused entries remain in the persistence service only; they are not yet
  surfaced through a recovery API/UI or resumed into live processes.
- 2026-06-30: Clarified the live integration shape. The first live persistence
  slice should cover only `deliveryIntent: "patient"` entries: the long-lived,
  visible, cancellable queue that waits for verified idle and can remain pending
  for many minutes. Short-term `deliveryIntent: "deferred"` entries and direct
  `MessageQueue` entries remain ephemeral because they only exist while a
  session is active, and an active session already blocks safe restart until it
  drains.
- 2026-06-30: First code slice implemented locally. Added a server-internal
  `SessionQueuePersistenceService` for
  `{dataDir}/session-queued-messages.json`, with atomic writes, serialized
  mutations, malformed-record filtering, empty-file cleanup, and load-time
  normalization of `queued`/`claimed` items to `paused-after-restart`. Focused
  service tests cover round-trip behavior, restart normalization, malformed
  disk input, concurrent upserts, empty cleanup, and invalid caller mutations.
  No live `Process.deferredQueue`, `MessageQueue`, route, UI, or safe-restart
  call sites are wired yet.
- 2026-06-30: Tactical draft opened from discussion. The intended direction is
  to make normal per-session queued messages durable enough to survive a YA
  server restart, eventually letting safe restart drain or preserve them the
  same way Project Queue now does. At draft time this was preparation only:
  session queued messages were process-local and lost on process/server
  restart.

## Context

YA currently has two different queue layers:

- **Project Queue** is durable project-scoped backlog. It is written to disk and
  survives YA server restart.
- **Per-session queued messages** are process-owned. `MessageQueue` holds direct
  provider queue entries, and `Process.deferredQueue` holds two different
  delivery intents:
  - short-term `deferred` entries, which promote at the current provider
    boundary;
  - long-lived `patient` entries, which wait for verified idle.

Short-term `deferred` entries and direct `MessageQueue` entries remain
server-authoritative only while the process is alive. Patient entries are now
persisted while queued; recovered paused entries are surfaced in session views,
can be deleted or resumed one at a time, and are reported to safe restart as
preserved work rather than drain blockers.

That split is mostly reasonable, but it leaves a hole for dev restarts and hard
server exits: a user may have several normal session queued messages visible in
the UI, restart the backend, and lose those messages even though Project Queue
items survive.

The desired preparation is to define durable queued-message semantics before
hooking persistence into live dispatch.

Related docs:

- `topics/queued-messages.md` - current contract: server-authoritative queue
  state with patient-only disk persistence.
- `topics/queue-across-compaction.md` - standing patient queue should survive
  provider compaction/restart boundaries.
- `topics/project-queue.md` - durable backlog and restart-paused semantics.
- `docs/tactical/036-project-queue-dispatch-pause.md` - Project Queue
  pause-after-restart and dev safe restart.
- `topics/architecture-mandates.md` - no idle/session background loop may
  consume resources forever.

## Current Baseline

The original queued-message contract intentionally said the queue was
ephemeral:

- the client does not persist queue entries in `localStorage`;
- the server owns queue truth while the `Process` exists;
- refresh/reconnect shows whatever the server process reports;
- process restart/session stop drops the queue.

This draft now narrows that contract for the patient queue only. Live patient
entries are persisted while queued, and restart recovery is visible for
server-reported `paused-after-restart` patient entries. Do not promise recovery
for short-term deferred or direct queue entries.

## Product Decisions

- Patient queued messages are **durable server state while queued**, not client
  state. The client still renders only server-reported queue entries.
- Restart recovery should be **paused after restart** by default. Loading
  persisted session queued messages must not auto-send them before the user has
  inspected interrupted sessions.
- Empty persisted state should normalize away. There is no hidden paused state
  for an empty session queue.
- Queue identity must be server-owned and stable. Do not match, recover, or
  delete queued messages by text.
- YA-visible session ids remain canonical. Provider-native ids may be stored as
  resume handles, but cannot replace YA session ids in persisted queue records
  or UI/API payloads.
- Direct queue and deferred/patient queue entries should be modeled separately
  because they have different runtime ownership:
  - direct entries are waiting in `MessageQueue` for the provider iterator;
  - short-term deferred entries remain YA-owned only until the current active
    session reaches its next provider boundary;
  - patient entries remain YA-owned until verified idle and are the only first
    live persistence target.
- The first live persistence slice is **patient-only**. Do not persist direct
  `MessageQueue` entries or short-term `deliveryIntent: "deferred"` entries for
  restart/safe-restart behavior.
- A very small crash window around queue-to-provider handoff is acceptable for
  this feature. Exactly-once/idempotent provider delivery is not a prerequisite
  for persistence prep.

## Non-Goals

- Do not persist queue entries in browser storage.
- Do not persist short-term `deliveryIntent: "deferred"` entries for safe
  restart. They only exist while a session is active, and that active session
  already blocks safe restart until the entry is promoted or drained.
- Do not persist direct `MessageQueue` entries for safe restart. They are also
  tied to an active provider process/iterator boundary.
- Do not resurrect messages that were already handed to the provider and
  should now be represented by provider transcript/history.
- Do not add queue editing, reordering, or richer queue management as part of
  persistence.
- Do not make safe restart depend on a full production lifecycle manager.
- Do not persist arbitrary process runtime machinery such as timers, listeners,
  async iterators, liveness snapshots, provider child process handles, or
  pending tool approvals.

## Durable Envelope

The first useful shape is a serializable queue envelope, not a persisted
`Process` object:

```ts
type PersistedSessionQueueKind = "direct" | "deferred" | "patient";

type PersistedSessionQueueStatus =
  | "queued"
  | "paused-after-restart"
  | "claimed";

interface PersistedSessionQueuedMessage {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  projectId: UrlProjectId;
  projectPath: string;
  provider: ProviderName;
  executor?: string;
  model?: string;
  serviceTier?: string;
  mode?: PermissionMode;
  kind: PersistedSessionQueueKind;
  message: UserMessage;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  queuedAt: string;
  status: PersistedSessionQueueStatus;
  source?: {
    clientId?: string;
    tempId?: string;
    requestId?: string;
  };
}
```

Notes:

- `kind: "patient"` is the durable form of
  `message.metadata.deliveryIntent === "patient"` and should continue to use
  the verified-idle path for providers where that matters. This is the only
  kind the first live persistence slice should write.
- `kind: "deferred"` is turn-end deferred delivery. The schema can represent it
  for future compatibility, but restart/safe-restart persistence should not
  write it in the agreed first live slice.
- `kind: "direct"` is a message accepted by YA for normal provider queueing but
  not yet known to have been yielded to the provider. The schema can represent
  it for future compatibility, but restart/safe-restart persistence should not
  write it in the agreed first live slice.
- `message.tempId` can continue to support client chip clearing, but the
  durable queue id is the authoritative server id.
- Attachments are only persistable if they already point to durable
  server-owned uploaded-file records or stable paths. Browser `File` objects,
  blob URLs, and temporary local-only handles are invalid.

## Persistence Semantics

Suggested backing file:

```text
{dataDir}/session-queued-messages.json
```

Persistence rules:

- Use serialized mutations and atomic writes, matching Project Queue and other
  server metadata stores.
- Validate and normalize on load. Drop malformed items rather than blocking
  server startup.
- Group and order by `sessionId`, then queue order.
- Preserve FIFO order within each session and kind unless existing runtime
  behavior explicitly joins or promotes multiple messages at once.
- On startup, convert recoverable `queued` or `claimed` entries to
  `paused-after-restart`.
- Empty session groups are removed from disk.
- Startup should not create or retain a provider process solely because
  persisted queue entries exist.

`claimed` is intentionally weak. It is a local bookkeeping state for "YA was in
the act of handing this message toward runtime dispatch." After a hard restart,
it should be recoverable as paused unless a later implementation has stronger
evidence that the provider accepted it.

## Runtime Integration Direction

The implementation order is staged:

1. Add shared/server queue envelope types, validation, and normalization tests.
2. Add a `SessionQueuePersistenceService` with load/save/mutation tests, but no
   live queue call sites.
3. Persist only `Process.deferredQueue` entries whose
   `message.metadata.deliveryIntent === "patient"`.
4. Rehydrate patient entries after restart as paused visible queue entries, not
   auto-dispatched work.
5. Keep short-term `deferred` and direct `MessageQueue` entries ephemeral for
   restart/safe-restart because their owning active session already blocks the
   safe restart point.
6. Teach safe restart to treat persisted patient entries as preserved work,
   while still reporting live active sessions as blockers.

Steps 1-6 are implemented for the patient queue. Safe restart now reports
already recovered `paused-after-restart` patient entries and converts live
patient queue backlog to that same paused recovered state once all volatile
work has drained. Project Queue promotion also treats recovered patient queues
as project-busy. Remaining follow-up work is project-level
visibility/control.

## Restart UX

After a server restart with persisted per-session queued messages:

- do not automatically resume delivery;
- show the queue entries in their normal session surfaces if the user opens the
  session;
- indicate that they are paused after restart;
- let the user delete individual entries;
- provide an explicit resume path before any entry is sent.

The paused state is queue-envelope state:

```ts
{
  id: "server-owned-durable-id",
  kind: "patient",
  status: "paused-after-restart",
  message: { text: "...", tempId: "..." },
  sessionId,
  projectId,
  queuedAt
}
```

It should not be embedded in `UserMessage`, because `UserMessage` is the
provider-bound payload that may later be sent verbatim.

This mirrors Project Queue's restart-pause principle, but the first UI surface
should remain session-local:

- session page: show recovered patient entries as normal queued-message chips
  with a paused-after-restart status, plus delete and later resume actions;
- project page: optionally summarize recovered patient entries near Project
  Queue controls, but make `Resume all` a follow-up after per-entry/per-session
  resume semantics are proven.

First recovery chunk:

1. [x] Add a shared queue-summary DTO with optional durable `id`, `kind`, and
   `status` fields.
2. [x] Decorate session detail and session metadata responses with recovered
   `paused-after-restart` patient entries, including alongside live process
   queue state.
3. [x] Add a delete endpoint keyed by durable queue id.
4. [x] Teach the client initial session load/metadata refresh to mirror recovered
   queue entries from the server response.
5. [x] Render recovered entries as paused chips; do not auto-dispatch.

Resume chunk:

- [x] resume one recovered entry by creating/attaching a session process and
  re-entering the patient deferred queue;
- [x] preserve per-session FIFO order by allowing only the oldest recovered
  entry to resume and rejecting resume behind live queued backlog;
- [x] add a read-only project-level summary that links recovered session queue
  groups back to their session pages;
- [ ] add optional project-level resume-all controls once the read-only summary
  and per-entry resume behavior are stable.

## Safe Restart Interaction

Today dev safe restart waits for active sessions and volatile in-memory queued
messages to drain. It also reports already persisted recovered patient entries
as preserved work, not blockers.

The agreed shape is:

- active provider sessions still block until they drain or are explicitly
  interrupted;
- short-term `deferred` and direct queue entries should drain before safe
  restart because they only exist inside an active session, and the active
  session is the blocker;
- already recovered `paused-after-restart` patient entries are preserved work
  and do not block restart;
- live persistable patient queued messages are flushed to disk, marked
  `paused-after-restart`, removed from live process queues, and reported as
  preserved rather than unsafe once all volatile blockers have drained;
- the banner can say why restart is blocked only for the remaining live
  blockers.

Recovered-work reporting and live patient-queue preservation at the safe
restart boundary are implemented.

## Verification

Schema/store tests:

- malformed persisted entries are ignored or quarantined without preventing
  startup;
- valid entries round-trip with stable ids and ordering;
- empty state normalizes to no file/no items;
- `claimed` entries load as `paused-after-restart`;
- YA session ids remain unchanged across serialization.

Runtime tests, when live persistence is wired:

- [x] patient entries are written to the persistence file while queued;
- [x] patient cancel/promotion removes the persisted item;
- [x] short-term deferred entries are not written to the persistence file;
- [x] patient entries survive server restart as paused API/UI state and do not
  auto-send;
- [x] deleting a recovered queued message removes it from disk and UI;
- [x] resuming recovered entries preserves per-session order for the
  implemented per-entry path;
- [x] scheduled safe restart preserves live patient entries as
  `paused-after-restart` only after active sessions and volatile queues drain;
- [x] Project Queue promotion still waits for recovered per-session queues
  before injecting project-level work;
- [x] Projects page renders recovered per-session queues above Project Queue
  items without treating them as Project Queue records;
- [x] safe restart distinguishes active live blockers from persisted preserved
  queued work.

Manual smoke:

- queue several patient messages during an active Claude session;
- restart the YA backend with those entries still queued;
- confirm the session shows paused recovered entries and no provider turn starts
  until explicit resume.

## Open Questions

- Should recovered session queued messages have a single global resume control,
  or only per-session resume/delete controls?
- Should a hard server restart and a scheduled safe restart produce the same
  paused-after-restart status, or should safe restart use a more specific
  "preserved for restart" status?
- Should recovered entries remember their original queue kind visibly, or is
  that only internal dispatch metadata?
- Is there any future non-restart use case for persisting short-term
  `deferred` or direct entries? There is no known need for safe restart.
