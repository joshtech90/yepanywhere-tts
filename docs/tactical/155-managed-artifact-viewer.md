# First-party hosted artifact viewing without a tunnel

Status: implemented, reviewed and integrated on main on 2026-10-16.
The fixed HTTPS host is deployed; YA client/server release publication is separate.
Owner: hosted artifact/file viewer.
Series: `relay-artifact-frame`.

## Product decision

The first-party hosted Yep Anywhere client supplies an isolated, managed
artifact viewer out of the box. Opening agent HTML with neighboring local
assets needs no extension, domain, tunnel, or artifact-listener configuration.
The trusted YA client reads files through its existing authenticated source
transport; remote bytes stay inside the encrypted relay. The content host
serves only the fixed viewer bootstrap and browser service worker.

The maintainer approved this default and autonomous end-to-end implementation,
real HTTPS verification, and incremental commits. No permanent staging stack
is needed. Existing explicitly configured custom artifact deployments retain
their current behavior and precedence. Local/direct and native clients retain
their existing paths until their respective delivery environments qualify.

This implements the [relay proposal](../../gaps/sketches/relay-artifact-frame.md)
and the hosted delivery portion of the [HTML viewer gap](../../gaps/html-document-viewer.md).
The [localhost follow-up](../../research/content-worker-localhost-spike/README.md)
proves native resource loading and lifecycle over the actual encrypted
transport, using a research parent. WebKit's larger-fetch failure remains
unresolved; it is not mobile acceptance. The extension adapter remains a
separate alternative, not a dependency.

## 1 — Preserve the experiment and infrastructure

Commit the localhost fixture, selected JSON evidence and findings without
screenshots. Commit the private DNS migration and DDNS maintenance separately
in dotfiles. Preserve unrelated extension work in the primary checkout.

## 2 — Enforce read-only preview leases on the YA server

Add authenticated preview admission and reads independently of the existing
public/local artifact listener. Reuse local file policy, session path scope,
canonical containment checks and opened-file response helpers. Existing durable
artifact grants retain their URLs, ownership and expiry/deletion semantics.
A preview lease never owns or deletes user files or creates project storage.

Proposed new API, relative to `/api`:

- `POST /artifact-previews` accepts an entry path and optional project id.
- `GET /artifact-previews/:id/file?path=<relative>` streams only admitted files.
- `DELETE /artifact-previews/:id` releases a lease.
- Session-scoped equivalents under `/sessions/:sessionId/artifact-previews`
  preserve sandbox path mapping and limited-user authorization on every read.

A lease identifies the admitting principal and optional session, canonical
root and entry; it expires and is revocable, process-bounded and read-only.
Recheck current file/session policy on reads. Reject traversal, encoded path
escapes, dotfiles, symlinks outside the root, cross-principal/session use and
excess file sizes/concurrency. Close streams on abort; expiry/release cannot
leave a general privileged fetch bridge. Server restart invalidates leases;
the viewer exposes Retry, which re-admits its original entry through the
trusted parent. Leases do not renew automatically.

This is a resource grant under the existing authenticated principal, not a
new identity system, hosted issuer or public bearer share.

## 3 — Publish a fixed, isolated HTTPS content host

Use per-viewer same-site origins under the first-party domain and an explicit
reserved hostname grammar. Prefer first-level labels to fit ordinary wildcard
TLS; verify the exact DNS/Worker arrangement before enabling the client.
Cloudflare's Worker serves only versioned bootstrap/worker files. Artifact
paths and API paths return inert failures on the network, never file bytes.

Restrict bootstrap embedding/handshakes to approved first-party client origins.
Use Origin-Agent-Cluster, response CSP, sandbox and no-referrer headers. Content
receives no YA credentials, storage, cookies, general URLs or arbitrary APIs.
The trusted parent validates source window, exact origin, protocol and viewer
identity; the server enforces the lease even if content forges all messages.

The browser worker scopes itself to the artifact subtree. Native relative
images, srcset, CSS imports/URLs, fonts, classic scripts, module graphs, JSON
fetches and linked documents resolve there without document rewriting.
Pull-driven streams have byte, request, concurrency and timeout bounds. Worker
restart discovers a live bootstrap rather than relying on worker-memory maps.
Closing a viewer aborts reads, closes ports, unregisters its worker and removes
its frames. Missing owners and lost control fail closed; versioned deployment
keeps active viewers compatible with their bootstrap.

## 4 — Use the existing managed file viewer

Capture the source runtime when opening each viewer. Never forward a request
through whichever host later becomes selected. Mount the managed viewer in
the existing pane and keep Source, reload, stop/retry, standalone YA viewer,
find and download/share flows coherent. Explicit custom artifact origins keep
their existing controls and URLs. Managed content URLs are not public shares.

Support standalone HTML and neighboring assets first, then the Visualize
fragment wrapper with bounded theme/widget-state and composer follow-up
messages. A follow-up populates the composer; it never submits automatically.
No running-app backend, arbitrary filesystem reads, WebSocket proxy, or new
public sharing system is part of this feature.

## 5 — Keep supported servers and deployments working

Compatibility corpus: latest stable servers `v0.9.2` and `v0.9.1`; no stable
server releases in the preceding 14 days on 2026-10-16. Both expose the older
listener-based `artifact-viewer` contract and lack the new preview API.

Add a separate permanent `artifact-relay-preview` capability introduced with
the next server contract release (`0.9.4` in the current registry). Support is
available in every official new server independently of listener settings, so
use version-implied advertisement with source-ahead capability metadata.
Do not broaden `artifact-viewer` or any existing flag. The parent makes no
new API call without the new gate. Missing gate or unsupported browser keeps
the configured custom viewer or today's scriptless/source fallback. Preserve
that fallback beyond the minimum release horizon.

The approved first-party default applies to recognized official hosted client
origins. Custom clients do not silently send traffic to first-party content
infrastructure; their existing custom viewer remains supported.

## 6 — Verify real HTTPS and the real YA pane, then land

First acceptance: an agent-generated `report.html` references `chart.png`;
opening the path in hosted YA displays an interactive report over encrypted
relay with no public artifact tunnel. Use temporary YA/relay/browser profiles
and a separately identified test browser. Keep all screenshots untracked.

Retain targeted server integration coverage for authority, traversal/symlinks,
policy changes, revocation/expiry and stream cleanup. Real browser evidence
must cover native resource types, blocked third-party cookies, navigation,
reload, worker stop/restart, concurrent viewers, teardown, denied reads and
network fallback, plus real sequential artifact/composer typing during live
updates (every key within 100 ms). Verify desktop and phone-width presentation
through the artifact capture facility. Qualify Chrome first; preserve fallback
for unqualified WebKit/native environments rather than claiming mobile support.

Run required lint, format, typecheck and unit gates, focused browser acceptance,
capability audit, CSS/console checks as applicable. Update the owning active-
content and compatibility contracts, record measured outcomes and commit each
reviewable slice. Deploy/verify the fixed content host before enabling hosted
client selection; do not publish a client that assumes old servers upgraded.

- [x] Actual YA pane integrated, including compatibility fallbacks.
- [x] End-to-end acceptance and required checks pass; slices committed.

## Implementation and evidence

- `de76c6a9c`: read-only server leases, current policy enforcement and the
  separate permanent capability. Five real-filesystem integration tests cover
  inert responses/ranges, traversal and symlinks, policy changes, expiry and
  revocation, principal/session binding and live-stream cancellation.
- `f189523cc`: the managed content host, captured-source parent broker and actual
  YA pane. The deployed host uses `artifact-<32hex>.yepanywhere.com`, fitting
  ordinary wildcard TLS; no artifact bytes go to Cloudflare. The shared find
  agent and bounded theme/widget-state/follow-up adapter work inside the pane.
- [Measured browser report](../../artifact-host/README.md#measured-qualification--2026-10-16)
  and [selected evidence](../../artifact-host/acceptance-results.json): real
  deployed DNS/TLS and public encrypted relay, artifact listener disabled,
  blocked third-party cookies. The first-party parent is the actual worktree
  build served through a test interception, not a published hosted release.
  Resource graph, navigation/reload, explicit worker restart, stream cancel,
  separate concurrent storage, find, fragment helpers and teardown all pass.
  All sequential keys appear within 6 ms during live transcript updates.
  Desktop and phone-width captures are inspected and remain untracked.

Final checks: root lint (zero warnings), format and typecheck pass. The initial full unit
suite passes: shared 962, push broker 45, relay 136, server 6,582 and client
6,989 assertions, plus root Node checks. The integrated main run also passes
(6,583 server / 6,992 client), with final hardening covered by 20 focused
client and six real-filesystem server cases. Existing artifact browser scenarios:
18/18 pass. Capability audit: 145 registered, zero errors, two unrelated
[overdue transition reviews](../../gaps/capability-transition-review-overdue.md).
The console scan's 108 inherited sites and Node loader deprecation are recorded
in [tooling debt](../../gaps/runtime-cutover-tooling-warnings.md); the managed
browser acceptance itself has zero console/page errors.

The first complete client run exposed an existing reverse-search test racing
deferred scroll alignment; `6da1bf34b` waits for the exact target rather than
loosening it. A later run's assertions all passed but a browser teardown hook
timed out while the manual browser qualification was active. The full suite
was rerun without that competing browser and passed.

## Remaining release and qualification boundaries

The implementation originated on `codex/managed-artifact-viewer` in the
requested worktree and was integrated on main at the maintainer's request,
preserving the primary checkout's extension changes. No YA server/npm, hosted client or native app release is published
by this work. A subsequent ordinary release must deliver the new server
contract; the hosted client keeps old-server/custom-origin fallbacks throughout.

Chrome is qualified. WebKit's larger-fetch behavior, native Android/iOS
WebViews, natural browser idle termination and advanced document inspection
remain separate work. Explicit worker termination/restart is measured; it is
not an observation of natural idle eviction. Absolute OS paths, root-relative
app routing, arbitrary external APIs, nested frames/workers and backends are
outside this entry-directory viewer. Linked HTML works; linked PDF/download
navigation has not been qualified in the managed path. Custom deployments
retain their existing broader contracts.

## Android emulator follow-up — 2026-10-16

Requested after the desktop qualification. Stock Android Chrome 124 on an
Android 15/API 35 emulator passes the managed-viewer resource and lifecycle
matrix over the real public encrypted relay and deployed HTTPS host. Explicit
cookie probes distinguish first-party acceptance from third-party refusal.
The harness now waits for a reload's actual navigation commit before testing
worker restart, avoiding the old document's ready state.

The bundled Debug app was built from this worktree with unchanged Kotlin/Rust
sources and the new web client. Its `appassets.androidplatform.net` origin
selects the existing static fallback, and this is observed in the actual app:
no managed frame, no script execution, and no relative PNG load. Native
interactive delivery still requires its own design/implementation. A native
fresh-pairing stall reproduces with main as well; the viewer check uses an
explicit cold-resume setup workaround and does not qualify fresh pairing.
See [the measured host report](../../artifact-host/README.md#android-emulator-qualification--2026-10-16)
and [the pairing gap](../../gaps/android-native-pairing-remains-busy-after-registration.md).
No APK, emulator state or screenshot is committed.

## Physical phone and review follow-up — 2026-10-16

The attached Android 17 phone passes all eleven hosted Chrome checks with
final main-checkout sources, including 24 concurrent requests, precise JSON,
binary and empty resources, and range headers/budgets over the encrypted relay.
The isolated bundled test APK also pairs through the fresh native UI and
verifies the intentional scriptless fallback. The test app was uninstalled;
no user app/browser data or settings were reset. Native interactive delivery
still needs its own WebView adapter; no parent allowlist was widened.

The requested YA API reviewer ran Claude Opus 5.5 with high effort. Its seven
functional findings and relevant hardening were addressed before landing;
[the host report](../../artifact-host/README.md#review-hardening) records the
changes, scope and remaining network/media limits. New regression checks
exercise queued/canceled resource bursts, lease loss/expiry, strict filesystem
read admission and range budgeting. Physical evidence is in
[the selected report](../../artifact-host/physical-acceptance-results.json).
Screenshots and APKs remain untracked. Release publication remains separate.
