# TypeScript Module Boundary Refactor

Topic: typescript-module-boundary-refactor

Status: Broad low-risk slices in progress; the remaining `sessions.ts`
route-registrar extractions are deferred.

## Contract

The binding rules for this campaign — slice discipline, naming, coordination,
tripwire matrix, verification tiers, stop conditions, and non-goals — live in
[`topics/typescript-module-boundary-refactor.md`](../../topics/typescript-module-boundary-refactor.md).
Read it before implementing any slice. This document is the worklog: baseline,
inventory, slice ledger, and landing notes.

## Goal

Reduce the largest TypeScript and TSX files by extracting clear module
boundaries, while preserving behavior, performance, public APIs, and the
documented architecture invariants.

This is not a blanket line-count campaign. Large files are prioritized when
they mix responsibilities that already have natural seams: route registration
versus route handling, page orchestration versus feature hooks, provider
protocol IO versus normalization, and DOM-local transcript behavior versus pure
selectors.

## Baseline Gate

Recorded before the first refactor slice so later regressions are attributable
to a slice instead of preexisting repo state.

| Check | Command | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lint | `pnpm lint` | Passed 2026-07-06 | 1s. Checked 1326 files, no fixes and no warnings. |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` | Passed 2026-07-06 | 8s. Includes `@yep-anywhere/shared` build. |
| Unit tests | `pnpm test` | Passed with baseline chatter 2026-07-06 | 44s. Existing stderr/WARN chatter observed; do not use this run as warning-free proof until the noted chatter is fixed or explicitly accepted per slice. |
| Client E2E | `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"` | Gate clarified 2026-07-06 | Use this as the full client/browser E2E gate for refactor slices. It excludes only the environment-gated physical Android device smoke; run `pnpm test:e2e:android` separately for Android/device-bridge slices. The initial baseline was recorded with raw `pnpm test:e2e`: 41s, 55 passed, 6 skipped, with existing Vite chunk-size/browser-compatibility warnings and Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings. |
| Server E2E | `pnpm test:e2e:sdk` | Passed with baseline chatter 2026-07-06 | 18s. 73 passed, 1 skipped. Existing negative-path WebSocket stderr observed. |
| Client console budget | `pnpm console:scan` | Passed at budget 2026-07-06 | 0s. 110/110 warning budget, +0 warnings; 158 info sites hidden by default. |
| Request census | `pnpm --filter client request:census -- --url <session-url>` | Skipped 2026-07-06 | No real session URL was supplied; run before session page/API refactors when available. |

Baseline notes:

- Recorded 2026-07-06 12:08 CEST at `3dd6f88b6d7eaff3b42153242b4f7891ef7c557b`
  and committed as `27dc30af`. The worktree was dirty at record time with
  unrelated project-queue changes (since landed as `eebd23f1`); no source
  movement had started for this refactor.
- Passing checks are attributable as pass/fail gates. The unit/E2E runs are not
  warning-free gates because they emitted existing test/logging chatter:
  settings-fetch stderr in client tests, server `CODEX_* slow scan` WARN logs
  against the local Codex session directory, expected negative-path
  WebSocket/auth stderr, Vite build warnings, and Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR`
  warnings.
- Client Tier 3 means the full browser/client Playwright suite excluding the
  physical Android device smoke: `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert
  "physical Android"`. The Android smoke remains mandatory only for slices
  that touch physical-device streaming, device bridge behavior, or
  Android-specific transport assumptions.
- The console chatter scan is at its current budget, not clean: 110 warning
  call sites, 0 over budget. Client slices must not increase that budget.
- Chatter fixes are their own slices (see the contract); do not bundle them
  into move slices.

## Large-File Inventory: 2026-07-06

Refresh cadence: at each phase completion, or when choosing the next phase's
slices — not after every slice. Generated/build/reference trees were excluded
with `rg --files`; specifically `node_modules`, `dist`, nested `dist`,
`references`, coverage and Playwright reports, and generated Codex
protocol/schema directories.

## Phase 0: Preparation And Tracking

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Recorded 2026-07-06 | Baseline gate | Run and record the baseline command set above. | Pass/fail baseline recorded; warning-free status is not clean because existing test/E2E chatter was observed. |
| 0.2 | Recorded 2026-07-06 | Large-file inventory | Refresh the production/test LoC inventory. | Recorded above; refresh at phase boundaries. |
| 0.3 | Done 2026-07-06 | Contract/worklog split | Extract the binding rules into `topics/typescript-module-boundary-refactor.md` and reconcile this plan with the former doc 053 child ledger. | This doc is the handoff surface for future sessions. |
| 0.4 | In progress | Slice ledger upkeep | After each slice, update the slice row and append a landing note. | Ledger update lands in the same commit as the slice. |

## Phase 1: Server Route Mechanical Splits

High value and comparatively low risk: route files have obvious endpoint
groups, and `create*Routes()` aggregators can remain stable.

**Ownership:** future `packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts` extraction
should revive or supersede the dormant child ledger in
[`053-sessions-route-refactor-ledger.md`](053-sessions-route-refactor-ledger.md)
and use SRR items there. That child ledger applies only to the server route
file and its `routes/session-*.ts` helper modules; it does not gate Phase 2
client session work, Phase 4 provider work, or Phase 6 test organization. The
ledger has already landed SRR-001 (request parsing helpers), SRR-002
(`providerResolutionDeps` dedup), SRR-004 (thinking launch options), SRR-005
(recovered queue helpers), SRR-006 (Claude resume guard), SRR-007 (worker queue
routes), SRR-008 (compact thresholds), SRR-009 (metadata patch parsing),
SRR-010 (queue summary shaping), and SRR-011 (provider resolution helpers) —
the flat domain-named
`routes/session-*.ts` pattern those items established is the pattern here. Do
not create a `routes/sessions/` directory or a shared helpers bucket.

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Done 2026-07-06 as SRR-010/SRR-011 | `sessions.ts` queue summary shaping + provider guards | Land SRR-010 (patient/deferred queue summary shaping into `session-queue-summaries.ts`) and SRR-011 (provider name guards and resolution deps into `session-provider-resolution.ts`). | Move-only; shaping and guards, not queue behavior. Restart/fork helpers are excluded — they are larger and behavior-heavy. Tier 1. |
| 1.2 | Deferred 2026-07-06 | Session detail routes | Extract metadata, agent content, and `GET /projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId` handlers behind a local registrar; propose as an SRR item first if revived. | Deferred because this is a route registrar move with pagination, compact-tail, augment, unread, and server-E2E tripwires; broader easier slices now have better value/risk. |
| 1.3 | Deferred 2026-07-06 | Start/create/resume/reactivate routes | Extract new-session, two-phase create, resume, and reactivation handlers; propose as an SRR item first if revived. | Deferred with the sessions route-registrar lane. Preserve provider selection, YA-visible session ids, executor persistence, queue-full behavior, and remote sync behavior if revived. |
| 1.4 | Deferred 2026-07-06 | Restart/fork/recap/retitle routes | Extract restart, fork, recap, fork-summary, and retitle flows; propose as an SRR item first if revived. | Deferred with the sessions route-registrar lane. Higher risk; preserve handoff/fork semantics and recap background behavior if revived. |
| 1.5 | Deferred 2026-07-06 | Queue/deferred routes | Extract message queue, deferred patient queue, steer/cancel, pending input, and mode routes. Builds on SRR-005 (recovered queue helpers, done in doc 053). | Deferred with the sessions route-registrar lane. Queue timers and idle ownership are load-bearing; read architecture mandates and run `test:e2e:sdk` if revived. |
| 1.6 | Deferred 2026-07-06 | Metadata/notifications routes | Extract metadata updates, mark-seen, last-seen, archive/star, and debug metadata routes. Builds on SRR-009 (metadata patch parsing, done in doc 053). | Deferred with the sessions route-registrar lane. Preserve event-bus update emissions if revived. |
| 1.7 | Done 2026-07-06 | `routes/settings.ts` parser split | Move settings parsers/discovery helpers out of the route factory. | Moved parser/discovery helpers into `settings-parsers.ts`; route factory still owns endpoints, callbacks, config precedence, and response shapes. |
| 1.8 | Not started | `app.ts` route composition cleanup | Extract app dependency construction or route mounting groups only after route modules are stable. | Do not alter middleware order, auth policy, or hosted-client endpoint selection. Coordinate with doc 054: workstreams slices (WS-004, WS-008, and later) actively mount routes in `app.ts`. |

## Phase 2: Client Page And Component Boundaries

Prioritize React files where one component function owns many unrelated hooks
and effects. Extract feature hooks/components while keeping visible behavior
and props stable.

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Done 2026-07-06 | `SessionPage.tsx` pure helpers | Move attachment conversion, text extraction, public-share prompt parsing, Codex config ack parsing, and title helpers into adjacent domain-named modules. | Move-only. Added focused helper tests; client console budget unchanged. Tier 2 because this is a client-visible page surface. |
| 2.2 | Done 2026-07-06 | `SessionPage.tsx` `/btw` aside orchestration | Extract aside prompt parsing, polling, split-pane focus state, and minimal aside composer helpers into a feature module/hook. | Moved `/btw` provider support, prompt/transcript parsing, poll/hydrate/run/stop state, split-pane routing, and shortcut handling into `useBtwAsides.ts`; page keeps generic composer transfer, custom command dispatch, and JSX wiring. |
| 2.3 | Done 2026-07-06 | `SessionPage.tsx` composer submission/attachments | Extract staged/uploaded attachment preparation and draft transfer helpers. | Preserved object URL cleanup and staged attachment batch invariants. Added focused helper tests; client console budget unchanged. Tier 3 substitute with focused client E2E. |
| 2.4 | Done 2026-07-06 | `MessageList.tsx` selection and quote behavior | Extract selected-text shielding, quote button placement, copy handling, and selection helpers. | Moved DOM-local selection/quote behavior into `useMessageListSelectionQuote.tsx`; `MessageList.tsx` still owns transcript rendering, scroll/follow state, search, and row actions. Tier 3 substitute with focused client E2E. |
| 2.5 | Not started | `MessageList.tsx` scroll/follow snapshots | Extract scroll-follow, catch-up, and retained scroll snapshot hooks. | High risk. Tripwire matrix: rendering row (`RENDERING_PERFORMANCE.md`, scrollback stability). Tier 3 plus manual browser pass. |
| 2.6 | Done 2026-07-06 | `MessageList.tsx` isearch UI state | Extract reverse search state/projections that are still DOM-local. | Moved React state, match projections, visible-group filtering, panel rendering, guide dispatch, and repeat timers into `useMessageListIsearch.tsx`; pure search selectors stay in `lib/sessionDetail/search.ts`. Tier 3 substitute with focused client E2E. |
| 2.7 | Done 2026-07-06 | `MessageInputToolbar.tsx` view/control split | Separate toolbar measurement/overflow logic from presentational controls. | Moved bottom-row overflow measurement helpers, layout signature, measured tier hook, and layout refs into `useMessageInputToolbarLayout.ts`; compact status/liveness display behavior remains in the toolbar. Tier 3 with client E2E. |
| 2.8 | Done 2026-07-06 | `MessageInput.tsx` textarea mechanics | Move undoable textarea edits, resize/collapsed cursor scrolling, slash suggestion matching, and speech target id helpers. | Browser undo/focus call sites stayed in `MessageInput.tsx`; focused helper/MessageInput tests and client E2E preserve behavior. |
| 2.9 | Done 2026-07-06 | `NewSessionForm.tsx` project/options helpers | Move project sorting, provider option resolution, recap/prompt-suggestion defaults, and attachment helpers. | Moved pure helpers only; i18n copy, workstream selector behavior, and staged upload/submission effects stayed in the form. Focused helper tests were added. |
| 2.10a | Done 2026-07-06 | Git diff large-preview admission guard | Add the server/client guard prerequisite before moving `GitStatusPage.tsx` diff preview components. | Server now returns bounded `previewSkipped` metadata before syntax highlighting oversized git previews; client also refuses to inject oversized highlighted HTML from older servers. |
| 2.10 | Done 2026-07-06 | `GitStatusPage.tsx` diff preview module | Extract diff fetch/render preview components after large-diff admission guards are in place. | Moved diff preview fetch/render, modal, skipped-preview state, and low-level diff renderers into `GitStatusDiffPreview.tsx`; page keeps selected-file/action/untracked-folder state and owns route-retention writes. |
| 2.11 | Done 2026-07-06 | `SessionPage.tsx` `/btw` sticky cards | Move sticky `/btw` footer-card JSX into a focused render component after slice 2.2 moved the orchestration hook. | Render-only follow-up to slice 2.2. `SessionPage.tsx` still owns composer routing and callback wiring; focused component tests cover actions and expanded transcript transfer. |

## Phase 3: Existing Architecture-Aligned Migrations

These areas already have accepted topic/tactical documents. This worklog does
not fork their plans; it only records where LOC reduction can happen as part
of their planned slices.

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Done 2026-07-06 | `useSessionMessages.ts` adapter cutdown | Continue the existing session-detail data-layer migration by shaving reveal/progress/pagination bookkeeping into tested helpers. | Moved returned-detail reveal gating, store-backed return selection, empty transcript fallbacks, returned tool-use map construction, and exported agent-content types into `sessionDetail/returnedDetail.ts` / `sessionDetail/types.ts`; hook still owns async load/reveal timing and stream/scroll side effects. |
| 3.2 | Done 2026-07-06 | `clientSummaryState.ts` source-store helpers | Split pure collection/reducer/query helpers only when touching summary-state behavior. | Moved shared summary collection model/defaults into `clientSummaryCollections.ts` and read-only query/selector helpers into `clientSummaryQueries.ts`; reducer/update paths stay in `clientSummaryState.ts`. |
| 3.3 | Not started | `SecureConnection.ts` internals | Extract only when aligned with source-transport boundary work or clear pure helpers. | Owned by `topics/source-transport.md` / doc 057; preserve parity rows and full transport tests. |
| 3.4 | Done 2026-07-06 | `api/client.ts` Git domain client | Extract the first domain-specific API module once source transport shims are stable. | Moved Git endpoint wrappers into `gitClient.ts` and the current-source JSON fetch helper into `sourceApiFetch.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade and `fetchJSON` export stable. |
| 3.5 | Done 2026-07-06 | `api/client.ts` Auth domain client | Continue with standalone endpoint clusters only when they stay behind the stable facade. | Moved auth status/setup/login/logout/password/localhost-access wrappers into `authClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade and `AuthStatus` type export stable. |
| 3.6 | Done 2026-07-06 | `api/client.ts` Recents domain client | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Moved recents fetch/visit/clear wrappers into `recentsClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade stable. |
| 3.7 | Done 2026-07-06 | `api/client.ts` Onboarding domain client | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Moved onboarding status/complete/reset wrappers into `onboardingClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade stable. |
| 3.8 | Done 2026-07-06 | `api/client.ts` Browser Profiles domain client | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Moved browser-profile list/delete wrappers into `browserProfilesClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade stable. |
| 3.9 | Done 2026-07-06 | `api/client.ts` Server Metadata domain client | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Moved version, server-info, env-settings, and restart wrappers plus their public types into `serverMetadataClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade and type exports stable. Network binding stayed in `api/client.ts` because it mutates runtime listener configuration. |
| 3.10 | Done 2026-07-07 | `api/client.ts` Push Notifications domain client | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Moved push public-key, subscribe/unsubscribe, subscriptions, test, delete, and notification-settings wrappers into `pushClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade stable. `getConnections` stayed in `api/client.ts` because it is connected-device state, not a push route. |
| 3.11 | Done 2026-07-07 | `api/client.ts` File/Diff domain client | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Moved file fetch, raw file URL, and diff context expansion wrappers into `fileClient.ts`; kept the exported `api` facade stable. |
| 3.12 | Not started | `api/client.ts` additional domain clients | Continue extracting non-session endpoint clusters that stay behind the stable facade. | Good candidates: small read-only settings helpers. Treat public-share as session-adjacent, settings writes as moderate risk because of custom clear semantics, and network binding as runtime configuration work. |

Phase 3 scope note:
- Further `useSessionMessages` / `SessionDetailCoordinator` orchestration is
  out of scope for this lower-risk 058 pass. Doc 051 identifies the next
  coordinator move as consolidating the remaining initial-load effect into
  named hook/coordinator phases; that touches warm hydration order, reveal
  timing, progress state, stream-gate opening, cache writes, and missing-store
  diagnostics. That is real session-detail lifecycle work, not a small
  move-only module-boundary cleanup. Revive it through the session-detail/source
  runtime plans when those semantics are the priority.

## Phase 4: Provider Adapter Splits

Provider files are large, but they touch upstream-facing behavior. Prefer
extracting pure protocol/model/normalization modules with strong fixtures.

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Not started | `sdk/providers/codex.ts` app-server client | Move `CodexAppServerClient`, JSON-RPC queueing, process termination, and raw request helpers into focused modules. | Tripwire matrix: Codex row. Run Codex provider tests and server E2E. |
| 4.2 | Done 2026-07-06 | Codex model catalog helpers | Move fallback model data, semver parsing, model sorting, and model metadata normalization. | App-server process/query/cache ownership stayed in `codex.ts`; focused catalog tests pin fallback selection and normalized ordering. |
| 4.3 | Done 2026-07-06 | Codex notification guards | Move `as*Notification` guards and raw notification classifiers into a protocol module. | Guard-only extraction; approval request param guards stay in `codex.ts`. Focused guard tests and existing Codex provider fixtures preserve stream/persisted conversion behavior. |
| 4.4 | Not started | Codex live event conversion | Move live turn state, streaming message construction, and item-to-SDK conversion. | Higher risk; preserve live-delta suppression and replay behavior. Tier 3. |
| 4.5 | Done 2026-07-06 | Codex recap/summary helpers | Move recap prompts, fork-backed summary prompt/params, retitle prompt, helper model selection, text cleanup, and summary capture helpers. | App-server orchestration and non-turn request decline behavior stayed in `codex.ts`; focused helper/provider/render-parity tests preserve provider-visible prompts and summary output behavior. |
| 4.6 | Done 2026-07-06 | OpenCode provider model helpers | Move OpenCode model selection, local-GLM model descriptions, and verbose variant parsing. | Provider process/HTTP/SSE orchestration and message conversion stayed in `opencode.ts`; no Claude/OpenCode shared abstraction introduced. |

## Phase 5: Load-Bearing Supervisor And Process Files

Intentionally late. Size alone is not enough reason to split these files
because they own process lifecycle, replay, fan-out, idle cleanup, queues, and
heartbeat behavior.

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Deferred | `Process.ts` pure helper extraction | Move static/pure helpers for message text, API retry status, permission pattern matching, and formatting when touched. | Move-only; no stream/replay/timer changes. Tripwire matrix: architecture-mandates row. |
| 5.2 | Deferred | `Process.ts` recap helper boundary | Consider extracting recap generation helpers if recap work resumes. | Preserve native recap waiters and pending recap flow. |
| 5.3 | Deferred | `Process.ts` queue persistence helpers | Consider extracting patient/deferred queue persistence helpers only with queue-specific tests. | Idle sessions must not retain repeating work. |
| 5.4 | Deferred | `Supervisor.ts` recap/compaction helpers | Extract pure compaction threshold, heartbeat candidate, and recap helper functions opportunistically. | Do not alter worker pool, preemption, liveness, or heartbeat scheduling. |

## Phase 6: Tests And Fixtures Organization

Large tests are acceptable when they read like scenario ledgers, but splitting
can improve review when scenarios are independent.

| Slice | Status | Target | Intent | Tripwires / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Done 2026-07-06 | `MessageList.test.tsx` scenario files | Split by behavior area: progressive rendering, thinking, queue rows, selection/copy, scroll, search. | Split into six scenario files plus `MessageList.test-support.tsx`; assertions and shared fixture behavior preserved. |
| 6.2 | Done 2026-07-06 | `process.test.ts` scenario files | Split by queue, approvals, replay/streaming, liveness, recap, termination. | Split into nine scenario files plus `process.test-support.ts`; fake-timer tests stayed in the liveness group and keep their existing `finally` cleanup. |
| 6.3 | Done 2026-07-06 | `codex.test.ts` fixtures | Move repeated raw notification fixtures and expected SDK outputs into fixture modules. | Extracted scenario-named event fixtures only; conversion calls and assertions stay explicit in `codex.test.ts`. |
| 6.4 | Not started | Route metadata tests | Split route metadata tests once route modules split. | Keep request/response assertions explicit. |

## Landing Notes

### Slice 3.11 — api/client File/Diff Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-07, this commit)

Moved:
- File fetch, raw file URL construction, and diff context expansion endpoint
  wrappers -> `fileClient.ts`.
- `FileContentResponse` type dependency -> `fileClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same `api.getFile`,
  `api.getFileRawUrl`, and `api.expandDiffContext` methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, URLSearchParams query encoding,
  raw file URL construction, diff expansion request bodies, current-source
  transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts
  src/components/__tests__/FileViewer.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration, file-serving
  server behavior, diff generation behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI
  behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.12 tracks remaining non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share remains session-adjacent, settings writes remain
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization, and network binding remains runtime configuration
  work.

### Slice 3.10 — api/client Push Notifications Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-07, this commit)

Moved:
- Push public-key, subscribe, unsubscribe, subscriptions list, test, delete,
  notification settings read, and notification settings update endpoint
  wrappers -> `pushClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same
  `api.getPushPublicKey`, `api.subscribePush`, `api.unsubscribePush`,
  `api.getPushSubscriptions`, `api.testPush`, `api.deletePushSubscription`,
  `api.getNotificationSettings`, and `api.updateNotificationSettings` methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request bodies, encoded delete
  ids, current-source transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.
- `getConnections` stayed in `api/client.ts`; it reads connected-device state
  from `/connections`, not a `/push/*` route.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts`; scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration,
  push-notification server behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI
  behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.11 tracks remaining non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share remains session-adjacent, settings writes remain
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization, and network binding remains runtime configuration
  work.

### Slice 3.9 — api/client Server Metadata Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Version, server-info, env-settings, and restart endpoint wrappers ->
  `serverMetadataClient.ts`.
- `VersionInfo`, `ServerInfo`, `EnvSettingEntry`, `EnvSettingsReport`, and
  `GetVersionOptions` type dependencies -> `serverMetadataClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same `api.getVersion`,
  `api.getServerInfo`, `api.getEnvSettings`, and `api.restartServer` methods.
- `api/client.ts` still re-exports the moved public metadata types.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, version refresh query behavior,
  current-source transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.
- Network binding stayed in `api/client.ts`; it mutates runtime listener
  configuration and is a separate risk class from metadata reads/restart.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts
  src/pages/settings/__tests__/LocalAccessSettings.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration, server
  metadata/admin behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.10 tracks remaining non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share remains session-adjacent, settings writes remain
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization, and network binding remains runtime configuration
  work.

### Slice 3.8 — api/client Browser Profiles Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Browser-profile list and delete endpoint wrappers ->
  `browserProfilesClient.ts`.
- `BrowserProfilesResponse` type dependency -> `browserProfilesClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same
  `api.getBrowserProfiles` and `api.deleteBrowserProfile` methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, encoded delete ids,
  current-source transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts`; scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration,
  browser-profile server behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.9 tracks additional non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share remains session-adjacent, and settings remains
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization.

### Slice 3.7 — api/client Onboarding Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Onboarding status, complete, and reset endpoint wrappers ->
  `onboardingClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same
  `api.getOnboardingStatus`, `api.completeOnboarding`, and
  `api.resetOnboarding` methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, current-source transport
  routing, and public call sites were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts`; scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration, onboarding
  server behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.8 tracks additional non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share remains session-adjacent, and settings remains
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization.

### Slice 3.6 — api/client Recents Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Recents fetch, visit-recording, and clear endpoint wrappers ->
  `recentsClient.ts`.
- `EnrichedRecentEntry` type dependency -> `recentsClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same `api.getRecents`,
  `api.recordVisit`, and `api.clearRecents` methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request bodies, current-source
  transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts
  src/components/__tests__/RecentSessionsDropdown.test.tsx
  src/pages/__tests__/NewSessionPage.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration, recents server
  behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.7 tracks additional non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share remains session-adjacent, and settings remains
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization.

### Slice 3.5 — api/client Auth Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Auth status, enable, disable, setup, login, logout, password-change, and
  localhost-access endpoint wrappers -> `authClient.ts`.
- `AuthStatus` type -> `authClient.ts`, re-exported from `api/client.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The exported `api` facade still exposes the same `api.getAuthStatus`,
  `api.enableAuth`, `api.disableAuth`, `api.setupAccount`, `api.login`,
  `api.logout`, `api.changePassword`, and `api.setLocalhostAccess` methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request bodies, current-source
  transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts
  src/pages/settings/__tests__/LocalAccessSettings.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration, auth server
  behavior, transport framing, or rendered UI behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints its
  existing negative-path server/client logs. No new chatter was attributed to
  this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.6 tracks additional non-session `api/client.ts` domain-client
  candidates. Public-share is explicitly session-adjacent, and settings is
  moderate risk because `updateServerSettings` preserves explicit clears with
  custom JSON serialization.

### Slice 3.4 — api/client Git Domain Client (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Current-source JSON fetch helper -> `sourceApiFetch.ts`.
- Git status, untracked-folder, remote-check, integration-options, pull, push,
  and diff endpoint wrappers -> `gitClient.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. `api/client.ts` still exports `fetchJSON`, and the exported `api`
  facade still exposes the same `api.getGit*` / `api.pullGit` / `api.pushGit`
  methods.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Endpoint paths, HTTP methods, request bodies, current-source
  transport routing, and public call sites were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/api/client.test.ts src/hooks/__tests__/useGitStatus.test.tsx
  src/pages/__tests__/GitStatusPage.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan` unchanged from the current budget.
- Tier 3 not run. This slice moved API wrappers behind the same facade and
  added facade-path tests; it did not change route registration, transport
  framing, or rendered UI behavior.
- Residual output: focused API tests still print the existing
  `ConnectionManager` transition lines, and the broad suite still prints
  existing negative-path server/client transport logs. No new chatter was
  attributed to this slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 3.5 tracks additional `api/client.ts` domain-client candidates. Session
  methods remain explicitly higher risk because they mix resume, queue,
  recap, provider-option, permission, and process-control behavior.

### Slice 3.2 — clientSummaryState Source-Store Queries (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Shared summary collection state, record, snapshot, query descriptor, provider
  runtime snapshot types, and immutable collection defaults ->
  `clientSummaryCollections.ts`.
- Global-session query descriptor/key helpers, provider/project/inbox/project
  queue/session selectors, active-activity classification, record-group
  ordering selectors, and `toProjectId` -> `clientSummaryQueries.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. Moved functions already accepted state or records explicitly.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `clientSummaryState.ts` still owns every `apply*` reducer
  entry point, observation freshness rule, summary merge rule, and source-store
  mutation path; callers now import selectors and shared collection types from
  their owning modules directly.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/lib/__tests__/clientSummaryState.test.ts
  src/lib/__tests__/sourceRuntime.test.ts
  src/lib/__tests__/clientSummaryStore.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`;
  `pnpm console:scan`.
- Tier 3 was not required: this moved pure summary model/query code and import
  paths only, with no route registration, client-visible surface, transport,
  or rendering behavior change.
- Residual chatter: full tests still emit the baseline broad-suite server/client
  logs, SecureConnection negative-path stderr, and server process termination
  warning/error logs already documented for this refactor series. Console scan
  stayed at warnings `110/110`, method.warn `61/61`, and method.error `95/95`,
  all `+0`.

Follow-ups recorded:
- None.

### Slice 2.11 — SessionPage /btw Sticky Cards (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Sticky `/btw` footer-card stack rendering, card action buttons, expanded
  transcript rendering, and transfer-to-Mother-composer button wiring ->
  `BtwAsideStickyCards.tsx`.

Signature conversions:
- `SessionPage.tsx` now passes aside card items and callbacks into
  `BtwAsideStickyCards`; the page still owns focused aside state, hide/stop
  handlers, expanded-state toggling, and composer-transfer behavior.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Card text/classes, expand/show behavior, Done/Hide/Stop
  actions, and expanded transcript transfer behavior were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/components/__tests__/BtwAsideStickyCards.test.tsx
  src/components/__tests__/BtwAsidePane.test.tsx
  src/hooks/__tests__/useBtwAsides.test.ts`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2/3: `pnpm test`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`;
  `pnpm console:scan`; Android-excluded client E2E via
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`.
- Residual chatter: full tests and client E2E still emit the baseline
  server/client log chatter, Vite chunk/browser-compatibility warnings, and
  Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings tracked in the baseline notes.

Follow-ups recorded:
- None.

### Slice 3.1 — useSessionMessages Returned-Detail Adapter Cutdown (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Returned-detail reveal gating, store-backed return selector memoization, empty
  returned transcript fallbacks, and returned tool-use `Map` construction ->
  `sessionDetail/returnedDetail.ts`.
- `AgentContent` / `AgentContentMap` hook exports now re-export the existing
  reducer/store types from `sessionDetail/types.ts` instead of duplicating the
  shape inside `useSessionMessages.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- `buildReturnedToolUseToAgent` accepts the revealed returned-detail slice
  explicitly so `useSessionMessages.ts` keeps the same memoization dependency
  as before.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `useSessionMessages.ts` still owns initial load and warm
  hydration timing, `useSyncExternalStore` subscription wiring, stream-buffer
  readiness, scroll refs, cache writes, and missing-store diagnostics.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/lib/sessionDetail/__tests__/returnedDetail.test.ts
  src/hooks/__tests__/useSessionMessages.cache.test.tsx
  src/lib/sessionDetail/__tests__/loadProgress.test.ts
  src/lib/sessionDetail/__tests__/revealSnapshot.test.ts
  src/lib/sessionDetail/__tests__/streamBuffer.test.ts`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2/3: `pnpm test`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`;
  `pnpm console:scan`; Android-excluded client E2E via
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`.
- Residual chatter: full tests and client E2E still emit the baseline
  server/client log chatter, Vite chunk/browser-compatibility warnings, and
  Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings tracked in the baseline notes.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Out of scope for the current lower-risk 058 lane: moving the remaining
  initial-load/warm-hydration orchestration into `SessionDetailCoordinator`.
  That work coordinates warm snapshot reveal, progress state, stream-buffer
  gate opening, cache writes, and missing-store diagnostics, so it should be a
  dedicated session-detail/source-runtime slice rather than a follow-up in this
  module-boundary cleanup.

### Slice 2.2 — SessionPage /btw Aside Orchestration (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- `/btw` provider support, prompt builders, side-request extraction, live text
  preview formatting, transcript-turn derivation, aside polling/hydration,
  fork/resume launch, stop/done state, split-pane collapse/focus state, and
  Ctrl+B routing -> `useBtwAsides.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- `SessionPage.tsx` now passes project/session ids, source API, effective
  provider/model/session metadata, permission mode, parent link, toast, and
  parent-navigation callback into the hook instead of letting the moved code
  close over the page.
- The page still owns the generic custom command dispatcher, Mother composer
  transfer/draft attachment behavior, sticky card JSX, and MessageList /
  MessageInput prop wiring.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `/btw` provider gating, unsupported-provider rejection,
  focused-aside composer routing, split-pane focus/collapse behavior, `/done`
  close-only handling, polling cadence, and parent-link hydration were
  preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/hooks/__tests__/useBtwAsides.test.ts
  src/components/__tests__/BtwAsidePane.test.tsx
  src/lib/__tests__/btwAsideRouting.test.ts`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2/3: `pnpm test`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`;
  `pnpm console:scan`; Android-excluded client E2E via
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`.
- Residual chatter: full tests and client E2E still emit the baseline
  server/client log chatter, Vite chunk/browser-compatibility warnings, and
  Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings tracked in the baseline notes.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Resolved by Slice 2.11.

### Slice 2.10 — GitStatusPage Diff Preview Module (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- `GitDiffPreview`, `GitDiffModal`, diff fetch/loading/error handling,
  full-context and markdown-preview toggles, skipped-preview rendering,
  highlighted diff injection, and plain diff-line fallback ->
  `GitStatusDiffPreview.tsx`.

Signature conversions:
- `GitStatusPage.tsx` now passes selected `fileKey`, retained diff scroll/view
  snapshots, and retention callbacks into the diff preview module instead of
  giving the extracted components the full `SourceControlRouteState`.
- The page still owns selected file state, git action state, untracked folder
  expansion, and route-retention writes.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. The skipped-preview behavior from row 2.10a, full-context
  loading, markdown preview toggle, split-pane scroll retention, and narrow
  modal behavior were preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/pages/__tests__/GitStatusPage.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2/3: `pnpm test`; `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`;
  `pnpm console:scan`; Android-excluded client E2E via
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`.
- Residual chatter: full tests and client E2E still emit the baseline
  server/client log chatter, Vite chunk/browser-compatibility warnings, and
  Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings tracked in the baseline notes.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `GitStatusPage.tsx` still owns git action state and untracked folder modal
  state; further Source Control page cleanup should be proposed as a new row if
  it still ranks above remaining Phase 2/4 items.

### Slice 2.10a — Git Diff Large-Preview Admission Guard (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- No component/module boundary move yet; this landed the documented prerequisite
  for row 2.10.

Signature/API changes:
- Added shared `GitDiffResult` and `GitDiffPreviewSkipped` response metadata
  for `/git/diff`.
- Client API typing now consumes the shared `GitDiffResult` instead of a local
  inline shape.

Behavior changes:
- Oversized git diff previews now return bounded skipped-preview metadata
  before syntax highlighting. The server skips untracked files above the
  256 KiB preview byte budget and skips any preview with a line above 20,000
  characters.
- The client renders a compact skipped-preview state and refuses to inject
  highlighted diff HTML above its defense-in-depth render budget.
- Normal small git diff previews still render highlighted diffs.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test --
  test/routes/git-status.test.ts`; focused
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test --
  src/pages/__tests__/GitStatusPage.test.tsx`; scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Tier 3: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test:e2e --grep-invert
  "physical Android"`.
- Client tripwire: `pnpm console:scan` stayed at warnings `110/110`,
  method.warn `61/61`, and method.error `95/95`, all `+0`.
- I18n advisory: `pnpm i18n:scan` reported only the preexisting three
  `main.tsx` raw-copy warnings.
- Residual chatter: root `pnpm test` passed with the existing broad suite
  server logs, negative-path WebSocket/SecureConnection stderr, and Codex
  slow-scan WARN entries already documented for this refactor series. Client
  E2E passed with the existing Vite browser-compatibility/chunk-size and Node
  `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Row 2.10 is now unblocked for extracting `GitStatusPage.tsx` diff preview
  fetch/render components into a focused module.

### Slice 4.6 — OpenCode Provider Model Helpers (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- `OpenCodeModelSelection`, `LOCAL_GLM_MODEL_PREFIX`,
  `getLocalGlmModelDescription(...)`, `parseOpenCodeModelSelection(...)`, and
  `parseOpenCodeModelVariants(...)` -> `opencode-models.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The moved helpers already accepted all inputs as parameters.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `opencode.ts` still owns CLI discovery, per-session server
  lifecycle, HTTP/SSE flow, liveness/status handling, interactive prompts, and
  message conversion.
- No provider-general or Claude/OpenCode shared abstraction was introduced.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test --
  test/sdk/providers/opencode-model-variants.test.ts
  test/sdk/providers/opencode.test.ts`; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Chatter: focused OpenCode provider tests retain their existing OpenCode
  server lifecycle info logs; root tests passed with the existing broad suite
  logging and negative-path stderr already documented for this refactor series.

### Slice 2.8 — MessageInput Textarea Mechanics (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Undoable textarea clear/range replacement, inserted-text derivation,
  expanded textarea resize, collapsed cursor scrolling, and draft line counting
  -> `composerTextarea.ts`.
- Leading slash suggestion query and slash command matching normalization ->
  `slashCommands.ts`.
- Client speech turn id and speech target id generation -> `speechTargets.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The moved helpers already accepted their DOM/text dependencies as
  parameters.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `MessageInput.tsx` still owns draft state, focus/ref timing,
  speech transaction state, submission routing, and slash command selection.
- Browser undo/focus preservation remains at the same call sites: `Ctrl+G`
  clear still edits the textarea before React state, and range replacement still
  goes through the textarea before updating draft state.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter client exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `pnpm --filter client test --
  src/lib/__tests__/composerTextarea.test.ts
  src/lib/__tests__/slashCommands.test.ts
  src/lib/__tests__/speechTargets.test.ts
  src/components/__tests__/MessageInput.test.tsx`;
  file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 3: `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`.
  The run passed with the documented Vite chunk-size/browser-compatibility and
  Node `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` baseline warnings.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Console budget: `pnpm console:scan` stayed at warnings `110/110`, method.warn
  `61/61`, and method.error `95/95`, all `+0`.
- Chatter: root `pnpm test` passed with the existing broad suite logging and
  negative-path stderr already documented for this refactor series.

### Slice 4.5 — Codex Recap/Summary Helpers (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Side-session recap prompt construction, fork recap/retitle/handoff prompt
  construction, fork helper resume params, recap helper-model selection, summary
  text cleanup/joining, raw response text extraction, and summary text capture
  from turn items/notifications -> `codex-summary-helpers.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- `captureRecapTextFromTurnItems(...)` and
  `captureRecapTextFromNotification(...)` became
  `captureCodexSummaryTextFromTurnItems(...)` and
  `captureCodexSummaryTextFromNotification(...)`. They now receive the
  provider's existing `normalizeThreadItem` function as an explicit dependency.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `codex.ts` still owns app-server lifecycle, timeout/abort
  flow, helper thread/fork execution, and non-turn server request decline
  behavior.
- Provider-visible prompt strings, developer instructions, timeout values,
  helper model preference order, and empty-summary errors are preserved.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test --
  test/sdk/providers/codex-summary-helpers.test.ts
  test/sdk/providers/codex.test.ts test/render-parity.test.ts`;
  file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Chatter: the root `pnpm test` run still emits existing unrelated suite
  stdout/stderr and the existing Codex reader slow-scan warning from default
  app-test access to `~/.codex/sessions`. The focused Codex
  summary/provider/render-parity runs for this slice were warning-free.

### Slice 4.3 — Codex Notification Guards (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Codex notification shape guards and the live-delta method/env classifiers ->
  `codex-notification-guards.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- Private provider methods such as `asTurnCompletedNotification(...)` and
  `asRawResponseItemCompletedNotification(...)` became exported
  `asCodex...Notification(...)` functions. Callers still pass the same unknown
  payloads and receive the same typed object-or-null result.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. The guard predicates and live-delta suppression env check are
  preserved.
- Command/file/permission/user-input approval request guards intentionally stay
  in `codex.ts`; they validate server request params, not notifications.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test --
  test/sdk/providers/codex-notification-guards.test.ts
  test/sdk/providers/codex.test.ts`; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Existing Codex provider fixtures were the relevant stream/persisted parity
  check for this slice because only guard/classifier placement changed; live
  conversion and durable item rendering stayed in `codex.ts`.
- Explicit parity: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test --
  test/render-parity.test.ts`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Chatter: the root `pnpm test` run still emits existing unrelated suite
  stdout/stderr and, in the normal local environment, an existing Codex reader
  slow-scan warning from default app-test access to `~/.codex/sessions`. The
  focused Codex guard/provider/render-parity runs for this slice were
  warning-free.

### Slice 6.2 — Process Scenario Test Split (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Shared Process test helpers (`createMockIterator`,
  `createControllableIterator`, `waitFor`, session-queue persistence setup,
  recap provider setup, and common Process/MessageQueue/type imports) ->
  `process.test-support.ts`.
- The 103 Process/MessageQueue scenarios -> `process.queue.test.ts`,
  `process.events-liveness.test.ts`, `process.runtime-status.test.ts`,
  `process.recaps.test.ts`, `process.deferred-queue.test.ts`,
  `process.lifecycle.test.ts`, `process.permission-mode.test.ts`,
  `process.message-history.test.ts`, and `process.termination.test.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. Test bodies keep the same assertions and setup. The split follows the
  former nested `describe` groups, with `deferred queue` separated from the
  ordinary message-queue and slash-command cases.

Behavior changes:
- None. This is test-only organization. The three fake-timer tests remain in
  `process.events-liveness.test.ts` and still restore real timers in `finally`
  blocks.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/process.queue.test.ts
  test/process.events-liveness.test.ts test/process.runtime-status.test.ts
  test/process.recaps.test.ts test/process.deferred-queue.test.ts
  test/process.lifecycle.test.ts test/process.permission-mode.test.ts
  test/process.message-history.test.ts test/process.termination.test.ts`;
  file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Integrity check: a local indentation-aware script verified all 103 moved
  `it(...)` bodies match `HEAD` exactly.
- Architecture tripwire: `topics/architecture-mandates.md` was read before
  editing because the split covers Process liveness, idle retention, deferred
  queue, interrupt, and termination tests.
- Chatter: the focused Process run and root test run still emit existing
  approval/termination/session logger stdout/stderr; this slice did not add
  production logging or change the test assertions that exercise those paths.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `process.deferred-queue.test.ts` remains the largest split file because the
  patient/deferred queue scenarios share promotion, persistence, and join-window
  setup. Further split it only if a queue-specific fixture helper can reduce
  repetition without hiding delivery-boundary inputs.

### Slice 6.1 — MessageList Scenario Test Split (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Shared jsdom cleanup, ResizeObserver setup, i18n mock translations, message
  builders, clipboard/pointer helpers, and the transcript harness ->
  `MessageList.test-support.tsx`.
- The 62 `MessageList` scenarios -> `MessageList.rendering.test.tsx`,
  `MessageList.thinking.test.tsx`, `MessageList.queue.test.tsx`,
  `MessageList.selection.test.tsx`, `MessageList.scroll.test.tsx`, and
  `MessageList.search.test.tsx`.

Signature conversions:
- None. Test bodies keep the same assertions and props. Scenario files import
  the shared support module before `MessageList` so the hoisted i18n mock is
  registered before the component under test loads.

Behavior changes:
- None. This is test-only organization.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test -- MessageList`; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`. The focused
  `MessageList` run was warning-free; the root test run still emitted existing
  unrelated suite stdout/stderr chatter.
- Client tripwires: `packages/client/RENDERING_PERFORMANCE.md`,
  `topics/scrollback-view-stability.md`, and `topics/console-chatter.md` were
  read before editing; `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget
  at warnings 110/110, `method.warn` 61/61, and `method.error` 95/95.
- Client E2E: skipped because no production client code or user-visible
  behavior changed; the split preserves the existing scenario assertions.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `MessageList.scroll.test.tsx` remains the largest scenario file because the
  scroll/follow cases share dense DOM geometry setup. Split it further only
  with enough helper extraction to improve readability without hiding the
  scroll-anchor inputs.

### Slice 1.7 — Settings Parser Split (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Settings request parsers, client-default merging, OpenAI-compatible helper
  target URL/model discovery helpers, file-access setting parsing, speech audio
  retention parsing, prompt-cache keepalive parsing, and cache-miss billing
  parsing -> `settings-parsers.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The route factory imports the same parser functions and still passes
  the same raw payload/current-setting values.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `settings.ts` still owns endpoint registration, runtime
  callbacks, `ServerSettingsService` calls, config default/precedence handling,
  public-share revocation, remote executor SSH testing, and response/error
  shapes.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `settings.test.ts`; file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Settings/config tripwire: `topics/hard-development-rules.md` was read before
  editing; the slice does not alter defaults, environment precedence, hosted
  endpoints, relay selection, migrations, provider/model defaults, or
  configuration persistence.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `settings.ts` still contains the large `PUT /api/settings` update flow. A
  later slice could extract a request-update builder only if it preserves the
  current error strings, callback order, and settings-service update shape.

### Slice 6.3 — Codex Provider Event Fixtures (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Live event-state test setup plus repeated Codex app-server notification
  fixtures and expected SDK/render outputs for agent message deltas, context
  compaction, interrupted turns, and raw function-call/result events ->
  `codex-event-fixtures.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- None. The tests still call `convertNotificationToSDKMessages()` directly and
  still assert concrete expected objects; only the literal fixture data moved.

Behavior changes:
- None. This is test-only fixture organization.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `codex.test.ts`; file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Codex tripwire: Codex provider tests ran. Stream/persisted render parity was
  not required because no production event conversion, persistence, or
  transcript rendering code moved.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Command-execution orphan/background-process edge-case notifications remain
  inline in `codex.test.ts`; move them only if a later fixture slice can keep
  those scenario assertions as readable as the current inline form.

### Slice 4.2 — Codex Model Catalog Helpers (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Current and legacy fallback Codex model lists, preferred model ordering, the
  GPT-5.5 fallback cutoff, semver normalization/comparison, app-server model
  shape, model list normalization, model metadata normalization, service-tier
  cleanup, sort ranking, and display-name formatting ->
  `codex-model-catalog.ts`.
- The former provider-private model-list assertion moved from the large
  `codex.test.ts` file to `codex-model-catalog.test.ts`, with added semver and
  fallback-selection coverage.

Signature conversions:
- `CodexProvider.getModelsFromAppServer()` now passes app-server model data to
  `normalizeCodexModelList()`.
- `CodexProvider.getFallbackCodexModels()` still owns CLI version discovery,
  then passes the normalized version to
  `getFallbackCodexModelsForCliVersion()`.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. `codex.ts` still owns model cache timing, CLI/app-server
  process execution, JSON-RPC model/list handling, and fallback-on-query-error
  behavior. The Codex CLI target version and compatibility markers were not
  changed.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `codex-model-catalog.test.ts` and `codex.test.ts`; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed
  with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Codex tripwire: `references/codex` was present; the Codex provider tests ran.
- Skipped: provider stream/persisted render parity, because this slice only
  moved model catalog selection/normalization and does not touch event
  conversion, persistence, or transcript rendering.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `CodexProvider` still owns app-server model/list process startup, JSON-RPC
  handshake parsing, cache TTL, and fallback decision timing. Those belong with
  the app-server client or provider lifecycle slices, not this catalog move.

### Slice 2.9 — NewSessionForm Helper Modules (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Pending new-session attachment union types, display metadata helpers, staged
  ref persistence, and object URL cleanup -> `newSessionAttachments.ts`.
- Recap/prompt-suggestion option ordering, default resolution, helper-side
  model default validation, and thinking launch option shaping ->
  `newSessionOptions.ts`.
- Project chooser sorting, typed-path normalization, typed-project lookup, and
  chooser/suggestion counts -> `newSessionProjects.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- The new helper modules take explicit project lists, provider capability
  objects, model lists, defaults, and pending-file values instead of closing
  over `NewSessionForm.tsx` locals.
- New-session staged attachment persistence reuses the existing session
  composer persistence helper for the shared `StagedAttachmentRef` shape.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. The New Session form still owns i18n copy, provider/default
  state transitions, WS-006 workstream selection, draft hydration, staged upload
  effects, and submission/project-queue orchestration.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`; focused
  `NewSessionForm` and new helper tests; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed
  with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Client tripwire: `topics/console-chatter.md` was read before editing and
  `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget.
- Client E2E: `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert
  "physical Android"`.
- Skipped: `pnpm i18n:scan`, because no user-visible copy moved or changed.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Stateful draft hydration, staged upload promises, local-file materialization,
  speech target helpers, and submission/project-queue orchestration remain in
  `NewSessionForm.tsx`; those need separate slices if they are moved.

### Slice 2.7 — MessageInputToolbar Layout Measurement (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Bottom-row overflow tier state, width/gap measurement helpers, toolbar layout
  refs type, and the pure overflow layout signature ->
  `useMessageInputToolbarLayout.ts`.
- `MessageInputToolbarView` now imports the measured overflow tier hook and
  signature builder instead of owning the DOM measurement loop directly.

Signature conversions:
- `MessageInputToolbarViewProps.refs` now uses the exported
  `MessageInputToolbarLayoutRefs` type. The hook still takes explicit
  `layoutKey`, `hasControls`, and optional refs.
- Existing focused tests now import
  `getComposerToolbarOverflowLayoutSignature` and its input type from the
  layout hook module.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. The CSS class names, overflow tier progression, resize
  observer scheduling, pinned-control handling, compact status float logic, and
  liveness display projection are unchanged. Compact status measurement remains
  in `MessageInputToolbar.tsx` because it is coupled to liveness/status
  projections rather than the bottom-row overflow menu.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `MessageInput`, `SessionToolbarPreview`, and
  `useSessionToolbarPresence` tests; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed
  with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Client tripwire: `topics/console-chatter.md` was read before editing and
  `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget.
- Client E2E: `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert
  "physical Android"`.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `MessageInputToolbar.tsx` still owns compact status/liveness projections and
  shortcut popover interactions. Those are separable future slices, but this
  slice kept the high-risk liveness display behavior local.

### Slice 2.6 — MessageList Isearch UI State (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Reverse-search React state, selected-target tracking, input/focus restore
  refs, arrow-repeat timers, match/selection/panel/navigator projections,
  visible-turn-group filtering, guide-state dispatch, search panel rendering,
  and query/case/selection callbacks -> `useMessageListIsearch.tsx`.

Signature conversions:
- The hook takes explicit `containerRef`, `displayRenderItems`, `turnGroups`,
  and `inert` inputs instead of closing over `MessageList.tsx` locals.
- `MessageList.tsx` keeps the keyboard coordinator for Ctrl+End/Ctrl+O and
  delegates search-specific actions to hook callbacks. Search Enter still calls
  `MessageList`'s `scrollToRenderId`, so transcript scroll/follow ownership
  remains in the component.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. The pure match, scope, panel-label, navigator-state, and
  visible-group selector functions stayed in `lib/sessionDetail/search.ts` via
  the existing `renderSelectors` surface.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `MessageList` and `renderSelectors` tests; file-scoped
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed
  with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`. The root test run still
  emitted the baseline suite chatter recorded above.
- Client tripwires: `packages/client/RENDERING_PERFORMANCE.md`,
  `topics/scrollback-view-stability.md`, and `topics/console-chatter.md` were
  read before editing; `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget.
- User-visible copy move: `pnpm i18n:scan` passed with the existing 3 warnings
  outside this slice.
- Client E2E substitute: focused `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --
  e2e/session-streams.spec.ts e2e/project-new-session-cta.spec.ts` passed
  with the existing Vite and `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings. The raw
  Android-including `pnpm test:e2e` command was not rerun for this docs/code
  slice because the previous run in this environment failed only in the
  environment-gated physical Android stream smoke (`2G0YC1ZF93041Z` reported
  `failed` instead of `connected`); the focused transcript/session specs are
  the relevant substitute under the pre-clarification gate wording.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `MessageList.tsx` still owns scroll/follow snapshots; row 2.5 remains the
  next `MessageList` boundary slice, but it is higher risk and should include
  browser/manual scroll verification if started.

### Slice 2.4 — MessageList Selection/Quote Behavior (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Transcript selection copy listener, coarse-pointer chrome shielding,
  selected-text quote button state/placement/rendering, keyboard quote typing,
  quote-anchor tint reconciliation, and text-block quote-circle mode handling
  -> `useMessageListSelectionQuote.tsx`.

Signature conversions:
- The hook takes explicit `containerRef`, `inert`, quote composer callbacks,
  composer draft state, `quoteClearSignal`, follow-button visibility, and an
  `isInteractiveTarget` predicate instead of closing over `MessageList.tsx`
  locals.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. The hook is called at the old selection-effect position so
  copy, selection, pointer, resize, scroll, and key listener registration order
  relative to the surrounding `MessageList` effects stays aligned with the
  pre-extraction code. `MessageList.tsx` still owns transcript rendering,
  scroll/follow state, search state, and row action wiring.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused `MessageList`, markdown-selection-copy, and comment-anchor tests;
  file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`; `git diff --check`; staged diff
  reviewed with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`. The root test run
  still emitted the baseline suite chatter recorded above.
- Client tripwire: `packages/client/RENDERING_PERFORMANCE.md`,
  `topics/scrollback-view-stability.md`, and `topics/console-chatter.md` were
  read before editing; `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget.
- Client E2E substitute: focused `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --
  e2e/session-streams.spec.ts e2e/project-new-session-cta.spec.ts` passed
  with the existing Vite and `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings. The raw
  Android-including `pnpm test:e2e` command was not rerun for this docs/code
  slice because the previous run in this environment failed only in the
  environment-gated physical Android stream smoke (`2G0YC1ZF93041Z` reported
  `failed` instead of `connected`); the focused transcript/session specs are
  the relevant substitute under the pre-clarification gate wording.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `MessageList.tsx` still owns scroll/follow snapshots and isearch UI state;
  rows 2.5 and 2.6 remain the next `MessageList` boundary slices.

### Slice 2.3 — SessionPage Composer Submission/Attachments (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Composer draft-transfer helpers -> `sessionComposerSubmission.ts`:
  `getComposerTransferReplacement`, `appendComposerTransferDraft`, and
  `appendSlashCommandDraft`.
- Submission attachment collection/materialization helpers ->
  `sessionComposerSubmission.ts`: `collectComposerAttachmentsForSubmission`,
  `createComposerDraftAttachmentState`,
  `splitComposerAttachmentsForSubmission`, and
  `materializeComposerAttachmentsForSubmission`.
- Core per-file composer upload preparation -> `sessionComposerSubmission.ts`
  as `uploadComposerAttachmentFile`.

Signature conversions:
- Attachment collection now takes explicit current attachments, pending upload
  promises, pending-message update callbacks, and composer-setter callback
  instead of closing over `SessionPage.tsx` refs/state.
- Materialization and upload helpers take explicit `sourceTransport`,
  `projectId`, `sessionId`, upload sizing, and progress callback parameters.
  `SessionPage.tsx` still owns React state transitions, API send branches,
  toasts, pending-message rows, and preview-cache side effects.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Draft clearing/restoring, object URL revocation, staged batch
  validation, pending upload waiting, and send/queue/project-queue API calls
  preserve the existing flow.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused attachment/draft tests; file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Client tripwire: `topics/console-chatter.md` was read before editing and
  `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget.
- Client E2E substitute: focused `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --
  e2e/session-streams.spec.ts e2e/project-new-session-cta.spec.ts` passed
  with the existing Vite and `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings. The raw
  Android-including `pnpm test:e2e` command was not rerun for this docs/code
  slice because the previous run in this environment failed only in the
  environment-gated physical Android stream smoke (`2G0YC1ZF93041Z` reported
  `failed` instead of `connected`); the focused session/page specs are the
  relevant substitute under the pre-clarification gate wording.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `SessionPage.tsx` still owns `/btw` orchestration and title-edit UI state;
  rows 2.2 and 2.4 remain the next high-value client-page/component slices.
- `NewSessionForm.tsx` has similar staged/direct attachment upload structure;
  leave that for row 2.9 rather than widening this slice.

### Slice 2.1 — SessionPage Pure Helpers (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- Composer attachment type guards/conversion/preview cleanup ->
  `sessionComposerAttachments.ts`.
- Turn/message text extraction -> `sessionMessageText.ts`.
- Public-share initial prompt parsing -> `sessionPublicSharePrompt.ts`.
- Codex config-ack parsing -> `sessionCodexConfigAck.ts`.
- Session page title display, retitle prompt, and generated-title insertion
  helpers -> `sessionTitleHelpers.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- Title display resolution now takes an explicit structural input object and
  returns `{ sessionTitle, headerAutoTitle, displayTitle, titleTooltip }`.
  `SessionPage.tsx` uses the same `displayTitle` and `titleTooltip` values as
  before.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. This is a pure helper move; `SessionPage.tsx` call sites,
  state ownership, API calls, rendering, and UI copy are unchanged.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`;
  focused client helper tests; file-scoped `node scripts/biome.cjs lint`;
  `git diff --check`; staged diff reviewed with `--color-moved`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Client tripwire: `topics/console-chatter.md` was read before editing and
  `pnpm console:scan` stayed within the committed budget.
- Client E2E: focused `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --
  e2e/session-streams.spec.ts e2e/project-new-session-cta.spec.ts` passed
  with the existing Vite and `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` warnings. The raw
  Android-including `pnpm test:e2e` command was attempted; the session/page
  specs passed, but the run failed in the environment-gated physical Android
  stream smoke because the attached device `2G0YC1ZF93041Z` reported `failed`
  instead of `connected`.

Follow-ups recorded:
- `SessionPage.tsx` still owns `/btw` orchestration, composer submission, and
  title-edit UI state; rows 2.2 and 2.3 are the next high-value page slices.

### SRR-009 — Session Metadata Patch Parsing (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- `PUT /sessions/:sessionId/metadata` request-body validation and
  normalization -> `session-metadata-patch.ts` as
  `parseSessionMetadataPatch`.

Signature conversions:
- The route now parses `unknown` JSON, receives either a normalized
  `SessionMetadataPatch` or an error/status pair, and passes the normalized
  patch to `SessionMetadataService.updateMetadata`.

Behavior changes:
- None intended. Metadata service updates, SSE event emission, route path, and
  response shape stayed in `sessions.ts`; parser tests pin the existing error
  strings and normalization rules.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/session-metadata-patch.test.ts test/routes/sessions-metadata.test.ts`;
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts packages/server/src/routes/session-metadata-patch.ts packages/server/test/routes/session-metadata-patch.test.ts`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Residual risk: the focused route test run still emits the preexisting
  sessions-metadata WARN/INFO log chatter for negative-path Claude
  resume/compact cases, and root `pnpm test` still emits the baseline suite
  chatter recorded above.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Phase 1.6 remains the larger metadata/notifications route extraction.

### SRR-005 — Recovered Queue Helpers (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- `ensureProcessForRecoveredItem`, `resumeRecoveredGroup`,
  `reportableProcessState`, and `resolveRecoveredGroupForDelivery` ->
  `session-recovered-queue.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- Recovered queue helpers accept `RecoveredQueueDeps` instead of closing over
  the sessions route's `deps`, `getGlobalInstructions`, and
  `persistLaunchMetadata`.

Behavior changes:
- None. Recovered-queue route handlers, route paths, response shapes, and
  `waitForPatientQueuePersistenceIdle()` waits stayed in `sessions.ts`.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/sessions-metadata.test.ts`;
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts packages/server/src/routes/session-recovered-queue.ts`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Tier 3 / tripwire: `topics/architecture-mandates.md` was read before
  editing; `pnpm test:e2e:sdk` was run for queue/liveness coverage.
- Residual risk: the focused route test run still emits the preexisting
  sessions-metadata WARN/INFO log chatter for negative-path Claude
  resume/compact cases, and root `pnpm test` still emits the baseline suite
  chatter recorded above.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Phase 1.5 remains the larger queue/deferred route extraction.

### SRR-004 — Session Thinking Options (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- repeated launch/resume/restart/message `body.thinking` conversion ->
  `session-thinking-options.ts` as `buildThinkingOptions`.

Signature conversions:
- The new helper accepts a narrow body shape with `thinking` and
  `showThinking`, then delegates to shared `thinkingOptionToConfig`.

Behavior changes:
- None. Model/default, service-tier, provider, executor, recap, and
  prompt-suggestion fallback rules stayed in `sessions.ts`.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/sessions-metadata.test.ts`;
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts packages/server/src/routes/session-thinking-options.ts`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Residual risk: the focused route test run still emits the preexisting
  sessions-metadata WARN/INFO log chatter for negative-path Claude
  resume/compact cases, and root `pnpm test` still emits the baseline suite
  chatter recorded above.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Phase 1.3 still owns route extraction for start/create/resume/reactivate
  paths; remaining model/default normalization can be revisited there if it
  stays move-only.

### Slice 1.1 — Sessions Route Helper Boundaries (Landed 2026-07-06, this commit)

Moved:
- `persistedPatientQueueSummary`,
  `recoveredPatientQueueSummaries`, `recoveredPatientQueueItems`,
  `sessionQueueSummaries`, `recoveredPatientUserMessage`, and
  `livePatientEntriesNewerThan` -> `session-queue-summaries.ts`.
- `isClaudeSdkProviderName`, `isCodexProviderName`, and
  `providerResolutionDeps` -> `session-provider-resolution.ts`.

Signature conversions:
- Queue summary helpers accept `SessionQueueSummaryDeps` instead of the route
  file's `SessionsDeps`.
- `providerResolutionDeps` accepts `SessionProviderResolutionDeps` instead of
  the route file's `SessionsDeps`.

Behavior changes:
- None.

Verification:
- Tier 1: `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit`;
  `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/sessions-metadata.test.ts test/routes/sessions-clone-codex.test.ts test/routes/recents.test.ts`;
  `node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts packages/server/src/routes/session-queue-summaries.ts packages/server/src/routes/session-provider-resolution.ts`;
  `git diff --check`.
- Tier 2: `pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm test`.
- Residual risk: the focused route test run still emits the preexisting
  sessions-metadata WARN/INFO log chatter for negative-path Claude
  resume/compact cases, and root `pnpm test` still emits the baseline suite
  chatter recorded above; chatter cleanup remains outside this move slice.

Follow-ups recorded:
- Phase 1.2 still needs a proposed SRR item before implementation.
