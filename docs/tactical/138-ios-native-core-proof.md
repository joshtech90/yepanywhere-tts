# iOS Native Shell And Shared Rust Connection Core

Topic: ios-native-core-proof

Status: direction accepted, 2026-10-01. Step 1's compatibility/build experiment
and engineering review are complete. The maintainer accepted the shared Rust
core and pinned SRP 0.7.0-rc.3, preserving the existing YA server protocol.
Production authentication and lifecycle gates remain before real credentials.
The production core and consumer iOS 17+ app are implemented. Bundled bridge,
native owner login and simulator lifecycle acceptance pass. Physical-device,
live notification and distribution acceptance remain step 4 release gates;
Android migration follows its broader multi-host/background parity.

## Scope And Existing Work

The selected mobile boundary is native owner login, reauthentication, saved
hosts/Switch Host, protected resume storage, transport and notifications, with
the full bundled web UI as the foreground application. Limited-user login
remains deferred for the initial release. This introduces no new principal,
grant, delegated credential, server route or authentication protocol.

Read the [Android connection foundation](081-android-native-connection-foundation.md),
[bundled web/native transport plan](083-android-bundled-web-native-transport.md),
[mobile pairing contract](../../topics/mobile-server-pairing.md),
[trusted packaging contract](../../topics/trusted-client-packaging.md), and
[resource ownership mandates](../../topics/architecture-mandates.md).
The [CI coverage inventory](../../gaps/ci-platform-coverage-holes.md) concerns
the simulator-control server, not an existing consumer iOS app. No matching
iOS app implementation plan was found in tasks/ or gaps/.

RSTorrent provides the reference pattern for SwiftUI, an in-process Rust
service, UniFFI, XcodeGen and simulator tests. Babytrack provides a reference
for Kotlin/Swift bindings and production-derived crypto fixtures. Their
authentication protocols cannot replace YA authentication. Keep this core in
YA; do not depend on another developer checkout.

## Accepted Ownership And Tools

| Layer | Proposed responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Existing React UI | Application screens and source operations |
| YA Rust core | SRP, proofs, resume, secretbox, connections, relay mux, reconnect, bounded requests/subscriptions/uploads |
| Swift shell | Native login/hosts, Keychain, WKWebView bridge, Apple lifecycle and notifications |
| Kotlin shell | Android platform adapters, eventually calling the same core |

Selected tooling is pinned Rust/Cargo, UniFFI Swift/Kotlin bindings, XcodeGen
and xcodebuild, with cargo-ndk for later Android integration. Shared networking
would use Tokio, tokio-tungstenite and rustls with platform certificate
verification; network dependencies are outside step 1. Secretbox should use
libsodium through a reviewed safe wrapper around libsodium-sys-stable. Pin
the actual libsodium source as well as Cargo crates; never fetch unpinned
latest library sources during a build.

The accepted backend is pinned RustCrypto srp 0.7.0-rc.3, using crypto-bigint
arithmetic designed for constant-time use. Its version-specific README reports
no independent third-party SRP audit; the maintainer accepts that limit with
the production gates recorded below. SRP 0.6.0 remains a variable-time
num-bigint differential oracle, not a shipping dependency. Do not hand-write
SRP arithmetic. The accepted compatibility and secret-ownership contract now
lives in [mobile pairing](../../topics/mobile-server-pairing.md#ios-and-shared-rust-direction).
No server changes, password resets or credential re-enrollment are needed.

## Implementation Sequence

### 1 — Prove the Rust crypto and native build path

Create an explicitly experimental, isolated YA Rust crate and binding harness.
Use the existing production TypeScript/Kotlin fixture as the oracle for the
2048-bit/SHA-512 SRP profile: A, M1, M2, raw S, base key, transport key,
XSalsa20-Poly1305 ciphertext, encrypted server-info proof and resume proofs.
Exercise malformed public values and tampered/wrong proofs and ciphertext.
Do not print secrets or turn fixture-only exports into shipping credentials.

Generate Swift and Kotlin bindings from the same pinned crate. Execute fixture
checks through both bindings; compile and execute the Swift proof on an owned
iOS simulator. Compile the device target separately and, where installed
tooling permits, Android arm64/x86_64 native libraries. Record actual versions,
reproducible commands, binary size and unsupported/unexecuted targets. Ignore
generated files and build output.

Produce a decision record separating wire correctness, packaging feasibility,
library security/maintenance suitability and missing integration evidence.
This step does not claim native login, networking, WebView behavior, Keychain,
background operation or release readiness. The maintainer reviewed the proof
and accepted the shared architecture and pinned backend on 2026-10-01.

### 2 — Prove the WKWebView bundled application and bridge

Create the consumer iOS SwiftUI/WKWebView shell, separate from the empty crypto
proof test host. Load the bundled UI and adapt its source transport contract
to WKWebView. Initially exercise the bridge with a deterministic native
SourceTransport test double, without borrowing web login or exporting keys.
Validate assets, SPA routes, storage, media, upload backpressure and sequential
keyboard input under concurrent streaming. Restrict the privileged bridge to
the owning bundled main frame/document. Measure WebKit byte transfers rather
than assuming equivalence to Android.

The checkpoint is a reproducible simulator test of the real bundled app:
source requests and subscriptions cross the native bridge, stale/foreign-frame
handles fail, streaming/uploads remain bounded, and each sequential keystroke
appears within 100 ms under expected volume. It is a bridge proof, not live
authentication. Avoid using the fixture verifier as a production login API.

### 3 — Deliver native owner login and the complete iOS connection path

Build the production Rust core with the pinned 0.7 backend and a reviewed
YA-profile adapter. First prove full SRP/server proof, encrypted requests and
subscriptions, resume and deterministic teardown on a direct connection to
the unchanged disposable YA server. Connect native Swift login and the
WKWebView bridge to that core. Add direct and relay/mux
routes with existing legacy fallbacks, independent host ownership and bounded
requests/subscriptions/uploads. Credentials never enter JavaScript.

### 4 — Complete Apple lifecycle and mobile acceptance

Add Keychain-backed persistence, Switch Host, reauthentication and app
relaunch/suspension behavior. Run owned simulator tests and CI, then physical
phone/tablet checks, including real notifications. iOS suspension must not
pretend to provide Android foreground-service behavior. Sequential typing
must acknowledge every keystroke within 100 ms under expected concurrent load.

### 5 — Migrate Android after the core demonstrates parity

Replace Kotlin connection internals incrementally behind the current shell
and source bridge. Preserve stored profiles, wire fallbacks, ownership,
existing acceptance tests and measured interaction/upload performance. This
migration is not a prerequisite for iOS or Android publication on their current
paths. It can begin once the iOS/Rust authentication, transport and lifecycle
checks pass; it does not require waiting for App Store publication.

## Current Checkpoint And Next Work

Steps 1–3 are complete. Step 4's Keychain, Apple lifecycle, notification
foundation and simulator acceptance are implemented; physical phone/tablet,
live APNs and signing/publication remain. Step 5 remains pending.
The iOS-first implementation now provides the consumer application, extending
the initial crypto test host. Android retains its working native-login/bundled-web
path recorded in [tactical 083](083-android-bundled-web-native-transport.md).

The consumer implementation is in packages/ios and packages/mobile-core.
Continue with real-device acceptance and distribution configuration, plus the
shared per-server native push enrollment plan. Android migration must additionally
preserve its existing multi-host/background demand, direct-route candidates and
physical mux pooling before replacing Kotlin. The initial iOS app's one foreground
circuit does not establish that parity. No server protocol migration is required.

## Evidence

### Crypto and binding results — 2026-10-01

The isolated [proof crate](../../packages/mobile-core-proof/README.md) has no
production app dependents. The original TypeScript/Kotlin fixture remains
byte-for-byte unchanged and its production generator check passes. Two extra
production-generated fixtures cover a Unicode password with minimal A/salt
and a leading-zero M1. They catch the padding and integer-encoding differences
that a single full-width transcript would miss.

RustCrypto srp 0.6.0 and 0.7.0-rc.3 both match A, x, verifier, k, padded u,
client/server S, server B, M1 and M2 without replacing their modular arithmetic.
YA's existing password-only hash and minimal M1/M2 encoding require an adapter;
neither candidate's high-level login API is a drop-in implementation.

Each of the three fixtures passes 27 compatibility properties and 17 rejection
checks. Generated Kotlin/JVM and host Swift bindings execute these same checks
and reject externally corrupted M2 and malformed JSON through typed errors.
Rust's three tests and all-feature Clippy pass. This is fixture compatibility,
not a live YA handshake or a protocol/session security assessment.

### Native packaging results — 2026-10-01

| Gate | Actual evidence |
| --- | --- |
| iOS simulator execution | Owned iPhone 17, iOS 26.5; two XCTest cases pass with zero failures through generated Swift bindings, including all three fixtures |
| iOS device build | arm64 Rust static library and unsigned Release app link successfully; no physical-device execution or signing claimed |
| iOS runtime linkage | Both app executables define the Rust proof entry point and have no Rust dylib dependency |
| Android compilation | cargo-ndk produces arm64-v8a and x86_64 libraries at API 26; no Android instrumentation claimed |
| Dependency advisory check | cargo audit reports no advisories in the final 146-dependency lockfile; this does not audit SRP or native libsodium |
| Repository checks | Root lint, format check, typecheck and all non-Android unit suites pass |
| Cleanup | Owned simulator shut down and deleted; generated bindings/build output remain ignored |

Final uncompressed sizes, including both SRP candidates and fixture harness
code rather than a selected shipping core:

| Artifact | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| iOS simulator static archive | 20,128,192 |
| iOS device static archive | 20,142,008 |
| Simulator statically linked app executable | 879,384 |
| Device statically linked app executable | 888,432 |
| Android arm64-v8a shared library | 918,928 |
| Android x86_64 shared library | 912,984 |

Static archives include object metadata/debug information; their sizes are not
installed app costs. Linked executable sizes include the empty SwiftUI test
host and generated bindings; no full YA app or APK size delta is established.

Tool versions: Rust 1.97.0; UniFFI 0.32.2; srp 0.6.0 and 0.7.0-rc.3;
crypto-bigint 0.7.5; libsodium-sys-stable 1.24.0 with hash/signature-verified
libsodium 1.0.22-stable source; Xcode 26.6 (17F113), Swift 5.10 language mode;
XcodeGen 2.45.3; Kotlin 2.0.21/JNA 5.17.0; Gradle 8.13; cargo-ndk 4.1.2;
Android NDK 27.0.12077973; Node 24.19.0 for fixture/check commands.

Reproduce from packages/mobile-core-proof with `node scripts/run.mjs all`.
The final local xcresult is ignored build/ios-1790836988462.xcresult. The runner
chooses an available runtime and creates/deletes its own simulator, so the
result filename and runtime may differ on another host. Linux/Windows, Intel
iOS simulator execution, physical iOS and Android execution remain unproved.

The first simulator build exposed Release @testable-import configuration and
an unbundled dylib chosen by `-l` over a colocated archive. The harness now uses
the public API and explicit static archive paths, then verifies final Mach-O
symbols/dependencies. Final platform compiler checks emit no warnings. The
repository unit run includes expected application warning logs from negative
fixtures; the touched native checks produce no runtime/compiler warnings.

### Accepted Checkpoint And Remaining Production Gates

Wire interoperability and native packaging are feasible; the maintainer has
accepted the shared Rust direction and pinned 0.7 backend. The production
adapter and session lifecycle verification is recorded in the consumer
acceptance below. The 0.6
num-bigint backend is variable-time and cannot establish
secret erasure; do not adopt it for production from this experiment. The newer
0.7 prerelease uses arithmetic designed for constant-time use, but still
reports no independent SRP audit, and adapter conversions/secret handling need
review. Compatibility is not a whole-protocol constant-time or security claim.

Before real credentials, verify hostile-input handling, proof ordering,
randomness, secret lifetimes and live session teardown/retry. Acceptance of
the RC is not a whole-protocol security certification. The installed Android
app, server protocol, owner-only scope and deferred limited-user login remain
unchanged until their explicitly planned implementation work.

### Independent engineering review — 2026-10-01

At the maintainer's request, Daybreak Blue reviewed fixed commit
`a0a964f64f462bb13975a4a2dc9f9508c2097714` through the local YA API.
The resolved model was `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest`, effort high, permission mode
plan/read-only. Session `01a0f642-4d87-7c00-a069-db22a1ee3215` completed with
verified-idle liveness and no queued work. Its detached checkout remained
clean. The reviewer inspected source and pinned dependencies; it did not
rerun the recorded tests. This is an independent implementation-agent review,
not a formal independent cryptographic audit.

**Verdict:** the isolated compatibility/build proof is valid. No critical
finding invalidates it. Provisional development use of 0.7.0-rc.3 is reasonable
behind a reviewed YA adapter. The review's high-severity findings are
conditions for the future credential-bearing implementation, not deployed
vulnerabilities in this fixture-only crate. The review itself did not authorize
architecture adoption; the maintainer subsequently accepted the checkpoint.

The accepted checkpoint decision is adoption of the shared Rust core and
pinned 0.7 backend, with the credential-bearing gates below verified before
real use. A modern authentication-suite migration
can follow separately; it need not delay the initial mobile release.

The implementation agent checked the substantive findings against source and
classified them below. Existing owner authentication remains the principal;
this work introduces no new grant or authority boundary.

| Finding | Disposition and next verification |
| --- | --- |
| Low-level 0.7 hooks rely on caller validation | Before real credentials, put a bounded, fallible YA-profile parser ahead of arithmetic. Exercise public values 0/N/2N/N±1, oversized input, malformed hex, salt/proof limits and zero u through the complete adapter/FFI entry point. Preserve supported minimal encodings: odd-length hex such as `1` is valid in existing YA fixtures, not automatically an error. |
| 0.6 variable-time arithmetic | Keep only as a differential test oracle. Exclude 0.6 and num-bigint secret arithmetic from the shipping core. No specific remote timing exploit was demonstrated. |
| 0.7 adapter timing and secret lifetime | Use fixed-width secret exponents and OS-generated private values; inventory copies and zeroizing owners. The proof still converts secrets through BigUint and variable-time encodings. Crypto-bigint's optional zeroization support is not enabled, and enabling it alone would not clear every temporary on drop. Whole-protocol constant-time behavior and complete erasure remain unproved. |
| Authentication ordering | Before persisting keys or notifying callers of authentication, verify M2 and server metadata according to YA's existing authenticated-version and legacy-fallback policy. Tampered, missing or mismatched proof fields must never produce an authenticated session outside that policy. Preserve the ordering in `packages/client/src/lib/connection/SecureConnection.ts` and the Android core. |
| Entropy, nonces, resume and retry lifecycle | Fixed fixtures do not prove these. Add live disposable-server tests for failed RNG, cancellation/retry, fresh challenges, stale proofs and sequence handling. Prove Android execution before migrating Android; its native libraries have only been compiled. |
| Sodium FFI bounds | No memory-safety defect was identified in the proof calls. The current 64 KiB fixture cap bounds allocations; unchecked `message.len() + 16` is not an unbounded-input attack through this API. Production wrappers need checked arithmetic, frame limits and fixed-size key/nonce types. |
| Build provenance | Rust/libsodium pins are effective for this proof. Release CI should pin ambient tools and verify Gradle/dependency artifacts. The reviewer cited a nonexistent proof-local Gradle wrapper; the actual shared wrapper is `packages/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`, which lacks `distributionSha256Sum`. This is release hardening, not a failed crypto/build experiment. |
| Offline guessing after verifier theft | Inherited protocol risk: YA's password-only SHA-512 profile has no memory-hard password KDF. A stolen salt/verifier permits offline guessing. Record this in any shipping risk decision; strong owner passwords and protected server storage matter. Rust adoption does not create or remove this property. |

"Needs review" therefore means assessing the exact library/adapter, verifying
the security-critical login lifecycle, and naming the risks the maintainer
accepts. Lack of a third-party audit does not establish a vulnerability or
automatically require commissioning an audit. Review dependency changes when
upgrading the pinned release candidate. Randomized differential tests,
hostile-input fuzzing and focused state-machine tests can extend the three
fixed transcripts without treating passing tests as a security certification.

### Possible later authentication-suite migration

Keeping SRP for compatibility while evaluating a newer PAKE is a reasonable
option. [OPAQUE, specified in RFC 9807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9807.html),
is a candidate, not a selected replacement or a prerequisite for the first
mobile release. Protocol age alone does not decide implementation safety.
The 0.6/0.7 numbers above identify library releases of the same SRP protocol.

A future `authSuite`/full-handshake version would be distinct from
`resumeProtocolVersion`, which versions proof and key-derivation semantics
for an existing credential. Authenticate the offered/selected suites and
identities, and retain an enrolled client's protection against silent
downgrade. A new protocol does not excuse incorrect validation, randomness,
proof ordering or storage in the current implementation.

The server stores an SRP salt/verifier, not the password. It cannot generally
convert that record into OPAQUE registration material. Migration requires
password re-entry/re-enrollment, or registration over an authenticated channel
during a successful full SRP login while the client still has the password.
A resume-only credential is insufficient. Select the OPAQUE configuration,
key stretching, libraries, browser/native interoperability, enrollment trust
and old-server transition policy in a separate reviewed migration plan.

### Consumer implementation and acceptance — 2026-10-01

Production Rust uses the pinned 0.7 backend without SRP 0.6/num-bigint. Twelve
Rust tests cover the production vectors, hostile resume context and downgrade,
pre-authentication allocation limits, subscription saturation and prompt socket
teardown. Direct, negotiated mux and exact legacy endpoints pass against owned,
unchanged YA fixtures, including encrypted requests/events, resume, staged uploads
and six sequential partial/full cancellations. Cancellation retains the unchanged
server's completed-draft TTL behavior. Native credential exports clear at close.

The iOS simulator passes native owner login, persistent host/credential storage,
atomic-write and locked-data failure cases, native P-256 continuity registration,
resumed check-in and durable revocation. The real bundled UI traverses projects
and sessions, acknowledges all 37 sequential keyboard characters within 100 ms
under a continuous 20 Hz transcript producer, preserves route/draft through suspension
and relaunch, and returns to native Switch Host. One captured run records
37 keys, zero drops, 57 ms maximum and 411 overlapping transcript mutations.
Source frames yield a paint slot;
upload acknowledgement waits for native consumption. Simulator media and hostile
entry-policy checks extend this checkpoint. Build/acceptance commands and actual
supported boundaries live in packages/ios/README.md.

The initial hosted run [36867518791](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36867518791)
passed Rust/live routes and all 16 hosted native tests, but failed UI latency
while its three-core/7 GiB host had severe CPU and memory pressure. The runner
now compiles the XCTest bundle before booting Simulator, executes native tests
first, and waits for host headroom before UI acceptance. It records pressure
during execution as well as before/after. The 100 ms input ceiling remains
unchanged; missing headroom fails readiness rather than skipping that gate.
Physical-device signing is a separate release step and cannot block simulator CI.

[Run 36887820073](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36887820073)
passed all 16 native tests, then failed host readiness: every one of its 44
samples had 0% idle CPU, with roughly 100–250 MiB available memory, while
first-boot iOS widgets and Spotlight competed for the standard VM's resources.
The Intel experiment pinned macOS 15 / Xcode 26.3 and iOS 18.6;
only its disposable VM disables indexing. [Run 36892794310](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36892794310)
showed that the older runtime settled to 76% CPU idle, but the 7 GiB arm64 VM
still had only about 100 MiB free, so the unchanged memory gate stopped UI
acceptance. The standard Intel VM has 4 CPUs / 14 GiB. Its simulator links the
`x86_64-apple-ios` Rust target; Apple Silicon keeps `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`,
and both device builds keep `aarch64-apple-ios`. The runner selects a device
supported by the requested runtime. The same
18 tests and strict CPU/memory and input-latency gates remain in both paths.
The native web source also retains status snapshots for repeated identical
phases, avoiding needless subscriber invalidation during incoming traffic;
distinct authentication/revocation phases retain their callbacks.

[Intel run 36898374886](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36898374886)
passed Rust/live routes and all 16 native tests, then failed UI readiness.
Its first-boot load peaked above 600 and all 31 readiness samples had 0% idle;
diagnosticd, Screen Time extraction and other simulator background work dominated.
CI now applies the documented `input-acceptance` profile to its disposable
simulator before boot and verifies the actual launchd state. It leaves native
networking, authentication/TLS, push, WebKit and input services enabled. Local
stock runs remain the default. No test or latency/headroom gate is removed.
Cold Intel elapsed time reached 42 minutes before UI/device acceptance, so the
whole-job limit is now 90 minutes (about twice that observation), separately
from the unchanged 100 ms input measurement.

Hosted run [36908114420](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36908114420)
passed all 16 native tests and readiness but failed typing at 370 ms, with no
dropped characters. During UI tests, every host sample showed zero idle CPU
and XCTest's screen-recording encoder consumed substantial CPU. Automatic
capture is now disabled with the scheme selecting screenshots; the five
explicit checkpoint attachments and failure diagnostics remain. Shell checks
assert native controls rather than section-heading case, which iOS 18 changes.
The workload and 100 ms ceiling remain unchanged. All 18 local simulator tests
pass; hosted validation is pending.

[Run 36915742761](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36915742761)
passed all 16 native tests and the shell assertion, and confirmed zero recording
encoder samples. Intel typing improved from 370 to 176 ms with no dropped
characters, but CPU remained saturated during typing and the page measured a
172 ms JavaScript long task. CI returns to macOS 15 Apple Silicon / Xcode 26.3
with iOS 18.6, the same service profile, screenshot configuration and all gates.
The earlier older-runtime arm64 run reached 76% idle CPU; its memory rejection
used free pages, before the availability correction. That experiment tested
the corrected configuration; its result follows below.

[Apple Silicon run 36921363142](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36921363142)
passed native tests, typed 37 characters with a 67 ms maximum, zero drops and
380 overlapping transcript mutations, and preserved the route/draft across
foreground and relaunch. Its default sidebar tap left the drawer closed on
iOS 18.6. The test now uses a single center tap based on the current WebKit
element frame and adds a drawer capture; hosted verification follows below.
All 18 local simulator tests pass with the explicit tap and drawer capture.
The same combined-source main CI failed draft history preparation: 6,000 real
save/clear writes took 74.6 seconds before any browser interaction. History is
now prepared in the fixture with a measured 300-second setup budget and yields
between batches; interaction and typing limits remain 60 seconds and 100 ms.
All six local draft browser cases pass.
Source `558d99dd3` passed [iOS CI 36926705262](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36926705262):
all 16 native and both UI tests, zero skips, full relaunch/Switch Host acceptance,
and the unsigned ARM physical-device build. Typing measured 26 ms maximum over
37 characters, zero drops and 342 overlapping transcript mutations. Six explicit
screenshots remain, with no recording encoder samples. The archive contains an
unsigned arm64 executable; no physical iPhone or signing credentials were needed.
[Main CI 36926705404](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36926705404)
passed all 24 jobs and 361 browser cases without retries. Draft history setup
measured 15.5 seconds; the interactive handoff passed in 22.9 seconds with the
unchanged 60-second interaction and 100 ms typing limits. Physical acceptance,
push delivery and distribution signing remain separate release work.

Local iOS 26.5 acceptance with the narrowed nine-service profile passes all
18 tests, including native login and streamed typing. The booted overrides are
verified; the final readiness pair records 51% and 72% idle CPU with more than
1.2 GiB free memory. Teardown removes the owned per-device override store.
The shared Darwin sampler also now uses Node's `process.availableMemory()`
and reports immediately free bytes separately. Earlier reports incorrectly
labeled `os.freemem()` as available memory, excluding reclaimable pages.
The 1 GiB availability threshold, CPU requirement and 100 ms typing ceiling
remain unchanged; a cached host no longer fails solely for low free pages.

The concurrent source repair `a5d1fa195` passed all 24 main jobs in
[CI 36899967113](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36899967113),
including 361 browser cases without retries. Native WebView typing peaked at
44 ms on desktop and 45 ms on phone under the unchanged 20 Hz / 1 MiB producer.
All twelve [runtime/SQLite legs](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36899967037)
and all [Desktop CI builds](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/actions/runs/36899967147)
also passed. Physical iPhone availability did not gate these results.

A Daybreak Blue read-only review of the first production checkpoint identified
eight concrete findings: abort protocol, resume-version pinning, non-atomic and
locked Keychain writes, cancellation/reconnect, discarded transport context,
event saturation, pre-auth allocation and credential lifetime. The implementation
addresses them with the tests above; this remains an implementation-agent review,
not an independent cryptographic audit. A second authorized Daybreak review
(session `01a0f722-f64c-7841-9801-dfb8d59385ae`) identified persistence before
continuity failure, cancellation across UniFFI, registration recovery, local
forgetting without revocation and queue-pressure attribution. Native durable
credential callbacks, Rust future cancellation, idempotent registration recovery,
server-first revocation/tombstones and per-owner bounded queues address them.

Hosted simulator tests verify successful TLS/SRP through an ephemeral trusted
root and reject an untrusted root, wrong hostname and expired certificate before
WebSocket upgrade. Only the owned simulator trusts that root; machine/user
trust is unchanged. A socket that stalls the handshake proves Swift cancellation
closes Rust within 500 ms. Broader hostile-peer/RNG/sequence fault injection and
fuzz coverage remain useful follow-up verification.

Initial Apple notification tests establish broker registration/rotation bounds
and protected opaque routing, not live APNs delivery or per-server enrollment.
No real owner credentials, developer YA configuration or user projects are used
by these fixtures. The consumer device target links unsigned; real-device,
provisioning and store publication remain explicit release work. Embedded
HTML/app viewers and Blob downloads remain bounded
[WebKit adapter gaps](../../gaps/ios-webview-viewers-and-downloads.md).

### Physical-phone acceptance — 2026-10-02

A development-signed device build installed through Machine Control and passed
15 native tests plus both UI tests on iPhone SE (3rd generation), iOS 26.6.1.
Native login/resume, Keychain, continuity registration/revocation, encrypted
WebView transport and cancellation passed. The real UI preserved its route and
draft across foregrounding and process relaunch and returned through Switch
Host to native management. All 37 sequential keys were acknowledged at a 33 ms
maximum, with zero drops and 226 overlapping transcript mutations.

Hardware exposed test-fixture assumptions: the producer's loopback address
pointed at the phone, the background UI runner had a separate local-network
permission gate, and retrying the same server restored its previous draft.
The test now derives its probe URL from the endpoint and supports a controller
producer, with a stronger overlapping-mutation assertion. Acceptance used a
fresh disposable server and a 50 ms controller append loop, recording 1,420
successful requests and no failures. Only the dedicated Debug QA host catalog
resets on first launch; ordinary credentials and resume/relaunch are retained.
SwiftUI's iOS 26 native Add host cell uses a stable identifier. Switch Host uses
one physical center tap from its current WebKit frame, independently confirmed
through Machine Control semantic control.

The selected 17 tests passed without skips; the simulator-only ephemeral-root
TLS test was deliberately excluded without changing phone trust. Simulator CI
retains that coverage. Development signing is now physically verified. Store
provisioning/publication, live Apple push, tablet acceptance and broader
network/media verification remain separate release gates. Screenshots and raw
results stay local; private signing/device/network details are not committed.
