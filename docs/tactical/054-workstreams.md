# Workstreams

Topic: workstreams

Status: Preparatory metadata/API/UI chunks and the first checkout creation
slice have landed. Workstreams remain hidden/no-op by default; no queue
targeting, scheduler change, delete/import route, sync action, or landing
action has landed yet. The pending plan was re-cut after the topic switched
from branch-backed git worktrees to ordinary repo checkouts.

Product rationale and the target user workflow live in
[`topics/workstreams.md`](../../topics/workstreams.md). This tactical document
tracks the implementation sequence for getting there without disturbing the
current Project Queue default behavior.

## Goal

Add an experimental, default-off workstreams mode where Project Queue can target
separate topic lanes under one YA project. A lane may be the canonical main
checkout or a separate real checkout — an ordinary local clone, not a git
worktree (see `topics/workstreams.md` "Lane Checkouts and Branches").
Workstreams should let prepared, known-independent topics make progress
without one active main/project session blocking every queued item.

The first implementation slices should make the model visible and testable
before they mutate Git or change Project Queue scheduling. Later slices should
make real checkout lanes useful before adding deferred branch/local-landing
machinery.

## Non-Negotiables

- Workstreams are hidden/no-op by default.
- Existing Project Queue behavior is unchanged unless the experimental gate is
  explicitly enabled.
- The preparatory API/UI slices do not create lane checkouts or run setup
  scripts, rebase, merge, cleanup, sync, or landing operations.
- Queue items must not be popped before start preflights pass.
- YA URL session ids remain the public/session-facing ids. Provider-native ids
  must not replace them in URLs, metadata, API payloads, or UI copy.
- Main checkout branch switching is never part of workstream execution. If a
  branch-backed lane is needed, create or import a separate checkout.
- User-facing copy says workstream, lane, or checkout. Reserve "git worktree"
  for technical comparisons, `.worktreeinclude`, and import of external git
  worktrees.
- PR creation is optional export, not the required local workflow.

## Relevant Context

- [`topics/workstreams.md`](../../topics/workstreams.md) - product model,
  metadata sketch, queue semantics, Workstreams page, sync, and deferred
  landing constraints.
- [`topics/project-queue.md`](../../topics/project-queue.md) - current
  single-lane Project Queue semantics.
- [`docs/tactical/023-project-queue.md`](023-project-queue.md) - original
  Project Queue implementation ledger.
- [`topics/vanilla-defaults.md`](../../topics/vanilla-defaults.md) - YA-novel
  user-visible behavior must be configurable and default-off.
- [`topics/architecture-mandates.md`](../../topics/architecture-mandates.md) -
  read before changing scheduler loops, retry timers, session liveness, or
  catch-up paths.
- [`topics/hard-development-rules.md`](../../topics/hard-development-rules.md)
  - read before changing deployment-sensitive defaults or configuration
  precedence.

## Chunk Details

### WS-001: Extract Project Queue Response Assembly

Status: done.

Implemented:

- Moved Project Queue response/enrichment helpers from
  `packages/server/src/routes/project-queue.ts` to
  `packages/server/src/routes/project-queue-response.ts`.
- Left `project-queue.ts` focused on Hono routes, request parsing, validation,
  mutation calls, and status codes.
- Kept API response shapes and scheduler behavior unchanged.

Goal: prepare the Project Queue route boundary for workstream display metadata
without changing behavior.

Likely change:

- Move response/enrichment helpers from
  `packages/server/src/routes/project-queue.ts` into a narrow module such as
  `packages/server/src/routes/project-queue-response.ts`.
- Keep `project-queue.ts` focused on Hono route mounting, request parsing,
  validation, status codes, and calling services.
- Move or expose these existing helpers through the new module:
  - recovered session-queue summary shaping;
  - target title enrichment;
  - global/project queue response assembly;
  - scheduler project-status response lookup.

Out of scope:

- no API response shape changes;
- no scheduler changes;
- no workstream fields;
- no route behavior changes.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/project-queue.test.ts
node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes/project-queue.ts packages/server/src/routes/project-queue-response.ts
```

Verified 2026-07-04 with the commands above.

### WS-002: Add Default-Off Experimental Gate

Status: done.

Implemented:

- Added a persisted server setting named `workstreamsEnabled`, defaulting to
  `false`.
- Added a Development settings UI toggle for the server setting. This is a
  developer-only UI surface, not an env var or deployment default.
- Allowed `PUT /api/settings` to update the setting when the request body
  supplies a boolean.
- Added client/server setting types and focused tests for the default, route,
  and UI visibility.

Goal: introduce the feature flag/config surface before any user-visible or
scheduler-visible behavior exists.

Likely change:

- Add a server setting named `workstreamsEnabled`.
- Expose that setting through the existing dev-only Development settings UI.
- Do not add an env-var override.
- Keep the default false.
- When disabled:
  - no Workstreams page/link;
  - no Project Queue target selector;
  - no session workstream badges;
  - no workstream API fetches from the client;
  - no Git commands;
  - no scheduler behavior changes.

Open decision:

- Deferred to the first real API/UI chunk: whether `/api/version` should expose
  a `workstreams` capability, or whether the client should treat
  `workstreamsEnabled` as the sole early gate.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/services/ServerSettingsService.test.ts test/routes/settings.test.ts
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test -- src/pages/settings/__tests__/DevelopmentSettings.test.tsx
pnpm i18n:scan

```

Verified 2026-07-04 with the commands above. `pnpm i18n:scan` reported three
pre-existing advisory raw-copy warnings in `packages/client/src/main.tsx`; no
new i18n warning was introduced by this chunk. Also ran `pnpm lint`.

### WS-003: Add Shared Types And Server Metadata Service

Status: done.

Implemented:

- Added shared workstream types, including `Workstream`, `StoredWorkstream`,
  `WorkstreamId`, `WorkstreamStatus`, `ProjectWorkstreamsResponse`, and the
  `workstreams-changed` event shape.
- Added `mainWorkstreamId(projectId)` so implicit main lanes have deterministic
  per-project identity instead of colliding as a plain `main` id.
- Added `WorkstreamService`, backed by `{dataDir}/workstreams.json`, for
  stored non-main workstreams.
- Synthesized the implicit `main` workstream at read time. The main lane is not
  persisted to disk.
- Added defensive load-time normalization, duplicate filtering, atomic temp-file
  saves, serialized mutations, and change events for future route/UI consumers.
- Exported the service from the server service barrel.

Goal: add durable identity for workstreams without touching Project Queue
scheduling.

Likely shared shape:

```ts
interface Workstream {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  label: string;
  kind: "main" | "checkout";
  path: string;
  branch: string | null;
  baseBranch: string;
  baseCommit: string | null;
  managedByYa: boolean;
  queuePaused: boolean;
  status: "active" | "archived" | "landed";
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

Likely server change:

- Add `WorkstreamService` backed by `{dataDir}/workstreams.json`.
- Use atomic write semantics and serialized mutations matching nearby metadata
  services.
- Do not persist Git cleanliness, ahead/behind counts, changed files, or
  mergeability.
- Synthesize the implicit `main` workstream at read time rather than writing
  one record per project immediately.

Out of scope:

- no route mounting or app startup wiring;
- no Workstreams page;
- no Project Queue target metadata;
- no lane checkout creation;
- no queue targeting;
- no scheduler changes;
- no client UI beyond tests or API scaffolding;
- no Git commands.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/services/WorkstreamService.test.ts
node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/shared/src/workstreams.ts packages/shared/src/index.ts packages/server/src/services/WorkstreamService.ts packages/server/src/services/index.ts packages/server/src/watcher/EventBus.ts packages/server/test/services/WorkstreamService.test.ts docs/tactical/054-workstreams.md
```

Verified 2026-07-04 with the commands above. Also ran `pnpm lint` and
`pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit`.

Amendment (2026-07-04, later): the stored `kind` literal shipped as
`"worktree"` and was renamed to `"checkout"` when the lane model dropped
git worktrees in favor of real checkouts (`topics/workstreams.md`, "Lane
Checkouts and Branches"). The service was still unmounted with no
persisted data, so no migration was needed.

### WS-004: Add Read-Only Workstream API Behind The Gate

Status: done.

Implemented:

- Added `WorkstreamService` initialization in the real server and passed it
  into `createApp`.
- Added `GET /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams`, mounted under
  `/api/projects`.
- Gated the route on `serverSettingsService.getSetting("workstreamsEnabled")`.
  Disabled mode returns a hidden/explicit `404` JSON response and does not
  resolve the project.
- The enabled response includes the implicit `main` lane plus any stored
  checkout lanes for the canonical project.
- Added route tests for disabled mode, invalid project ids, missing projects,
  main-lane synthesis, and stored checkout lane listing.
- Left the global `GET /api/workstreams` route unimplemented until a concrete
  caller needs it.

Goal: expose enough data for a hidden Workstreams page to render lanes.

Likely routes:

```http
GET /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams
```

Early behavior:

- routes are gated;
- disabled response is explicit and client-hidden;
- response includes implicit main lane plus stored records;
- no create/delete/update mutation route yet unless a manual import flow is
  intentionally included.

Out of scope:

- no Git commands;
- no queue target selector;
- no scheduler changes.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/workstreams.test.ts test/services/WorkstreamService.test.ts
node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes/workstreams.ts packages/server/src/app.ts packages/server/src/index.ts packages/server/test/routes/workstreams.test.ts
```

Verified 2026-07-05 with the focused test and lint commands above, plus
`git diff --check`.

### WS-005: Add Hidden Workstreams Page Shell

Status: done.

Implemented:

- Added hidden `/projects/:projectId/workstreams` routes in local and remote
  clients, with no navigation chrome.
- Added a typed client API call for `GET /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams`.
- Rendered the implicit main checkout and stored checkout lanes with label,
  kind, branch, queue state, status, session-count placeholder, and path.
- Kept the page inert when `workstreamsEnabled` is off.
- Added loading, error, no-access, disabled, empty, and main-only states.
- Added focused page tests.

Goal: create the experimental UI surface without changing default navigation.

Likely change:

- Add a route/page that renders only when workstreams are enabled.
- Show rows for `main` and any stored workstreams.
- Show lane label, path, branch, queuePaused, status, and linked session count
  placeholders as available.
- Use i18n keys for visible copy.

Out of scope:

- no lane checkout creation UI;
- no landing buttons;
- no scheduler state;
- no queue target picker.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test -- src/pages/__tests__/WorkstreamsPage.test.tsx
node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/client/src/pages packages/client/src/i18n/en.json
pnpm i18n:scan
```

### WS-006: Associate Sessions With Workstreams

Status: manual start-session association slice done; per-lane session counts
and Project Queue targeting remain deferred.

Goal: let sessions display their lane identity and let the Workstreams page
show associated sessions.

Implemented:

- Added optional `workstreamId` to YA session metadata and session summary
  response types.
- Kept missing `workstreamId` as the default: it resolves to the implicit
  main workstream for the session's effective project and is not eagerly
  written for existing sessions.
- Added server metadata helpers for setting/clearing a session workstream id.
- Added stored-checkout cwd resolution in `WorkstreamService`.
- Taught project scanning to collapse known lane cwd paths back onto the
  canonical project id instead of listing the lane checkout as a duplicate
  project.
- Invalidated scanner snapshots on `workstreams-changed` events and included
  the workstreams metadata file in the persistent project-scan cache source
  state.
- Added optional `workstreamId` handling to project-bound session start/create
  routes. A non-main target runs the provider in that checkout path while YA
  keeps the canonical project id in URLs, responses, and supervisor metadata.
- Preserved selected lane metadata for starts that pass through the supervisor
  capacity queue before a session id exists.
- Added an experimental New Session workstream selector, visible only when
  `workstreamsEnabled` is on, a known project is selected, and that project has
  a stored checkout lane. Main remains the default and sends no explicit
  `workstreamId`.

Likely change:

- Add optional `workstreamId` to YA session metadata.
- Existing sessions with no `workstreamId` resolve to the implicit `main`
  workstream.
- Session summaries/details may include a compact workstream display object
  when the experimental gate is on.
- UI can show compact identity such as `yepanywhere / xr blink / main`.

Lane session association rules:

- YA URLs, persisted YA metadata, REST/WebSocket payloads, and UI routing keep
  the canonical project id for the repository's main checkout.
- Starting a session in a non-main lane should use that lane's checkout path as
  the provider cwd, while storing `workstreamId` separately.
- For a root-level project, a YA-managed lane cwd is
  `{dataDir}/checkouts/<project-slug>-<project-id-hash>/<lane-slug>`.
- For a subdirectory project, YA clones the repository root under that same
  lane root, then uses the matching subdirectory inside the clone as the
  provider cwd.
- The `<project-id-hash>` segment is a short stable hash of the canonical
  project id, not the first characters of the base64url id; path prefixes are
  not unique enough across sibling projects.
- The session scanner must resolve any cwd equal to or inside a stored
  checkout lane path to the lane's canonical `projectId`. It must not create a
  separate project row for that checkout.
- Scanner recognition is intentionally metadata-backed. Arbitrary sibling
  clones or external git worktrees are not auto-associated until the user
  explicitly imports them.

Out of scope:

- no automatic reassignment of historical sessions;
- no Workstreams-page session counts yet;
- no Project Queue target picker or scheduling changes yet;
- no provider-native id changes;
- no broad queue scheduling changes.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/sessions-metadata.test.ts
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/sessions-workstreams.test.ts
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test -- src/components/__tests__/NewSessionForm.test.tsx
```

Verified 2026-07-05 with the new focused route and client tests above, plus
server/client typechecks, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm i18n:scan`, `pnpm console:scan`,
and `git diff --check`. `pnpm i18n:scan` still reports the three pre-existing
raw-copy warnings in `packages/client/src/main.tsx`; `pnpm console:scan` stayed
within the committed baseline and reported no new warnings.

### WS-007: Add Project Queue Target Metadata And Hidden Target Picker

Status: proposed.

Goal: allow a Project Queue item to remember a target workstream without using
that field for scheduling yet.

Likely change:

- Add optional `targetWorkstreamId` to shared Project Queue item summaries and
  persisted items.
- Keep it absent for all existing behavior.
- Validate that the workstream belongs to the same canonical project when the
  experimental gate is on.
- Add an experimental target picker on the hidden queue/workstream surfaces.
- Keep `new workstream` disabled or routed to an explanatory placeholder until
  checkout lifecycle support lands.
- Show target workstream metadata only on experimental surfaces.

Out of scope:

- no scheduler behavior changes;
- no checkout creation;
- no route that mutates workstream records unless it belongs to WS-008;
- no migration needed for existing queue files.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/project-queue.test.ts
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client test -- src/hooks/__tests__/useProjectQueues.test.ts
```

### WS-008: Add UI-Backed Lane Checkout Creation

Status: first create slice done; delete/import and durable failure rows remain
deferred.

Implemented:

- Added shared request/response types for checkout preview and creation.
- Added `GET /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams/checkout-preview` so the
  client can show the exact server-computed destination before create.
- Added blocking `POST /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams`.
- Created lanes as ordinary local clones under
  `{dataDir}/checkouts/<project-slug>-<project-id-hash>/<lane-slug>`.
- Left the canonical checkout unchanged.
- Set the lane clone's `origin` to the canonical checkout's own origin when it
  exists; otherwise the local clone source remains the origin.
- Copied `.worktreeinclude` entries after clone and before metadata is stored.
- Stored metadata only after clone and seed steps succeed; failed setup removes
  the partial checkout root.
- Enforced a per-project operation lock; concurrent create returns
  `409 operation_in_progress`.
- Added the hidden page `New workstream` form with label input, destination
  preview, disabled submit while creating, inline error display, and response
  refresh.
- Taught the client activity bus to accept `workstreams-changed` so other open
  hidden pages can refresh after server events.

Still deferred from the broader WS-008 plan:

- `DELETE` and `PATCH` workstream routes;
- durable failed-operation rows with `Retry` and `Delete`;
- progress polling or a generic operation resource;
- import of existing checkouts.

Goal: let a user press `New workstream`, have YA create the ordinary repo
checkout for that lane, and see a durable success or failure state without
using the command line. This still does not change scheduler behavior.

Likely routes:

```http
POST /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams
DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams/:workstreamId
PATCH /api/projects/:projectId/workstreams/:workstreamId
```

The first `POST` may either block the HTTP request while awaiting async git
child processes, or return `202 { operationId }` if the first implementation
needs progress polling. It must not use synchronous shell work that blocks the
Node event loop. Start with the blocking request unless clone/setup latency or
progress UX makes an operation resource obviously necessary.

Likely UI behavior:

- add a `New workstream` action on the hidden Workstreams page;
- collect the lane label and show the computed checkout destination before
  creation;
- disable the create action while a create operation is active for the
  canonical project;
- show a creating row or inline progress state while the operation is running;
- show success by rendering the new lane row from the API/EventBus result;
- show checkout creation failure as a first-class lane/operation state with the
  error/log, `Retry`, and `Delete` actions.

Likely creation behavior:

- create the lane checkout as an ordinary local clone on main;
- prefer a destination under `{dataDir}/checkouts/<project>/<lane-slug>`;
- keep the canonical project checkout unchanged;
- set the lane clone's origin to the project's shared upstream;
- rely on Git's local clone hardlinks when available, but treat object copying
  as a correctness-preserving fallback on filesystems that cannot hardlink;
- copy `.worktreeinclude` ignored files if present;
- store metadata only after clone and seed steps succeed;
- do not create a branch in the first version;
- do not run setup scripts or symlink directories by default.

Concurrency and operation semantics:

- enforce a per-canonical-project single-flight lock for checkout create,
  delete, cleanup, and future sync operations;
- a second create while one is active returns a clear
  `409 operation_in_progress` response rather than racing;
- releasing the lock is mandatory on success, failure, and client disconnect;
- the operation result is driven by server state, not by the initiating tab
  staying open;
- emit a workstreams/activity event on created/failed/deleted state changes so
  other tabs update without polling everything.

Secondary import behavior:

- import is an admin/debug affordance, not the main product milestone;
- when added, explicit import of an existing checkout path must verify that it
  belongs to the same repository;
- default imported lanes to read-only/unmanaged until the user marks them
  managed;
- detect external git worktrees only as import candidates, not as YA-owned
  resources.

Preconditions:

- experimental gate enabled;
- canonical project is a Git repository;
- checkout destination is available;
- no concurrent YA git operation for the same canonical project.

Out of scope:

- no setup/cleanup scripts;
- no scheduler behavior changes;
- no local landing;
- no automatic import of arbitrary external checkouts or worktrees;
- no generic job framework unless the checkout operation needs progress or
  survives beyond a single HTTP response.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/workstreams.test.ts test/services/WorkstreamService.test.ts
node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/routes packages/server/src/services packages/shared/src
```

### WS-009: Make Project Queue Scheduling Workstream-Aware

Status: deferred until WS-001 through WS-008 land.

Goal: change the idleness unit from whole project to target workstream when a
queued item has `targetWorkstreamId`.

Required reading before implementation:

- `topics/architecture-mandates.md`;
- `topics/project-queue.md`;
- `topics/workstreams.md`;
- `docs/project/server-message-routing.md` if the change touches process
  ownership, replay/catch-up, or server fan-out.

Likely change:

- Generalize `projectWorkIdle` from a project-id predicate to a scoped
  predicate that can evaluate only processes/sessions in one workstream.
- Keep the current whole-project predicate for items without
  `targetWorkstreamId`.
- Add one active provider turn per workstream.
- Add one claimed Project Queue item per workstream idle boundary.
- Start the provider session in the target lane checkout path.
- Require start preflights before claiming the queued item:
  - lane exists, is active, and is not paused;
  - no active provider turn in the target workstream;
  - no setup/cleanup/sync operation is running in that checkout;
  - no Git sequencer state in that checkout;
  - YA-managed lane checkouts have clean tracked files;
  - the main checkout keeps the clean-tracked-files gate opt-in.
- Leave a blocked item queued with a visible blocker instead of popping it.
- Keep global dispatch pause semantics.
- Add a per-project optional concurrency cap only after single-workstream
  semantics are correct.

Out of scope:

- no lane checkout creation beyond WS-008;
- no landing;
- no `.workstream` command checks;
- no auto-resolving conflicts.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/routes/project-queue.test.ts
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/services/project-queue-scheduler.test.ts
```

### WS-010: Add Shared-Upstream Lane Sync And Repair Turns

Status: deferred.

Goal: keep ordinary checkout lanes current through the shared upstream without
introducing branch-mode local landing.

Required reading before implementation:

- `topics/architecture-mandates.md`;
- `topics/session-liveness.md`;
- `topics/synthetic-turn-injection.md`;
- `topics/injected-message-visibility.md`;
- `topics/workstreams.md`, especially "Landing Back To Main".

Likely behavior:

- At each lane's agent-idle boundary, fetch from the shared upstream.
- If the lane has no unlanded commits and can fast-forward, fast-forward it
  silently.
- Never move a checkout while an active provider turn is running there.
- If a lane cannot fast-forward, do not leave it in a rebase/merge/cherry-pick
  sequencer state.
- Detect or dry-run enough to name the facts, then inject a visible factual
  repair turn in the lane session:
  - upstream/base moved to a specific commit;
  - the lane has N unlanded commits;
  - catch-up needs rebase, merge, or another strategy;
  - known conflicted paths, if YA can determine them without mutating the
    checkout.
- Exempt the repair turn from the readiness rule it exists to repair, while
  still enforcing agent-idle, clean tree, and no-sequencer-state preflights.
- Keep the prompt factual rather than prescriptive; standing agent
  instructions govern whether the agent acts autonomously or asks the user.

Out of scope:

- no branch-mode local landing action;
- no automatic rebase that rewrites unlanded commit SHAs;
- no hidden prompt framing;
- no semantic conflict inference;
- no auto-resolving conflicts.

Suggested verification:

```bash
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/server test -- test/services/project-queue-scheduler.test.ts
node scripts/biome.cjs lint packages/server/src/services packages/server/src/routes
```

### WS-011: Add Optional `.workstream` Readiness Checks

Status: deferred until the lane scheduler and sync behavior are stable.

Goal: let trusted repository content declare readiness gates beyond the built-in
clean/up-to-date facts.

Required reading before implementation:

- `topics/security.md`;
- `topics/workstreams.md`, especially "Queue Semantics";
- `topics/hard-development-rules.md` if any setting or trust precedence is
  added.

Likely behavior:

- Parse an optional project `.workstream` config from each lane's checkout.
- Support built-in gates such as up-to-date-with-base and mandatory command
  checks such as tests.
- Require an explicit trust step before executing repo-declared commands.
- Run checks in the lane checkout at clean, agent-idle boundaries.
- Own check logs and status rather than burying failures in provider output.
- Cache pass results by commit.
- Surface failed checks as visible lane blockers.
- Consider eager checks during user think time after a lane becomes clean and
  idle; cancel or invalidate runs if the checkout mutates.
- Keep failure repair-turn injection visible and configurable, because it would
  start provider work without a new user action.

Out of scope:

- no broad project-scoped settings system;
- no hidden check execution from untrusted repo content;
- no treating untracked files as dirty for the built-in clean gate.

### WS-012: Defer Branch Mode And Local Landing Plan

Status: not in the first ordinary-checkout version.

Goal: preserve the branch/local-landing design as a later option without letting
it shape the checkout-lane MVP.

Trigger conditions:

- users need isolation from upstream churn that plain main checkouts cannot
  provide;
- users want a reviewable local landing step before shared-upstream push;
- ordinary-checkout sync creates repeated repair-turn noise that branch mode
  would materially reduce.

Deferred branch-mode constraints:

- create/import a separate checkout; never switch the user's canonical main
  checkout to a feature branch;
- use YA-named branches as plumbing/visibility, not as user-chosen feature
  branches;
- no implied PR, no implied push, and no auto-land by default;
- require explicit project/user AGENTS notice and visible UI whenever YA runs a
  lane on a branch in an all-in-main project;
- re-cut a dedicated tactical plan before implementing branch-mode landing.

## Open Decisions

- Gate shape: version capability only when enabled, or capability always
  present with settings reporting disabled?
- Lane checkout destination: always under `{dataDir}/checkouts`, configurable
  root, or same-volume-near-project when possible for cheaper local clones?
- Is the first checkout create response a blocking `201 Created`, or a `202`
  operation resource with polling/activity updates?
- Should import of existing checkouts be deferred until after YA-managed
  creation works?
- Should the first Workstreams page live under Projects, Settings, or both?
- Should workstream queue pause be global state in `WorkstreamService`, or live
  inside Project Queue dispatch state once scheduling is lane-aware?
- Should the first scheduler cap allow unlimited active lanes, one non-main
  lane, or a small configurable cap?
- `.workstream` format and trust model: file name, syntax, approval granularity,
  pass-result cache key, and whether failed checks inject repair turns
  automatically.
- Deferred branch mode: branch naming pattern, branch upstream, and whether the
  first local landing mode is fast-forward only, squash only, or both.
