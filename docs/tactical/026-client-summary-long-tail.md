# Client Summary Long Tail

Status: Closed. Active close-out tracking moved to
[`030-client-summary-store-closeout.md`](030-client-summary-store-closeout.md).

This doc is the historical long-tail migration plan after the client summary
store became the shared home for session, project, queue, inbox, and draft
summary facts. The broad migration has been completed or narrowed into a small
close-out list. Continue from
[`030-client-summary-store-closeout.md`](030-client-summary-store-closeout.md)
instead of treating this file as the active task list.

Closure summary:

- shared session, project, inbox, queue, and draft summary facts now live in the
  source-scoped `clientSummaryStore`;
- feed hooks still own readiness, fetch, loading, error, pagination, and
  mutation-control state;
- heavy session transcript, stream, liveness, pending-input, and process-detail
  state intentionally stays local to session/process hooks;
- remaining active work is limited to shared mutation helpers and narrow
  selector cleanup, tracked in `030`.

The source-registry work is implemented in
[`027-client-summary-source-registry.md`](027-client-summary-source-registry.md).

## Target Invariant

Shared summary facts are read from `clientSummaryStore`.

In hosted remote mode, "shared" means shared within the current backend source,
not across every saved host. Current-source selectors must not render stale
records from the previous host while a new host is connecting or loading.

Feed hooks own:

- remote/local readiness gates;
- current summary source key capture;
- targeted REST requests;
- loading and error state;
- pagination and mutation control state;
- request start timestamps;
- reporting accepted snapshots and successful mutations into the store.

Store selectors own:

- session rows and query membership;
- project rows and project-list membership;
- project queue summaries;
- inbox tier membership and derived counts;
- lightweight local decorations such as draft badges;
- cross-slice projections used by shared UI surfaces.

UI surfaces should not render authoritative session, project, inbox, or queue
rows directly from a hook-local array when those rows represent shared summary
state.

## Store Boundary

Good store candidates:

- session summary records;
- project summary records;
- project queue item summaries;
- inbox tier ids and counts;
- active/needs-attention session ids by project;
- server settings and client defaults that multiple surfaces render or mutate;
- recent-visit membership, if composed with session/project summaries;
- local decorations whose value affects shared session cards.

Keep out of the store:

- full session messages;
- raw JSONL and provider transcript payloads;
- streaming transcript deltas;
- rendered transcript bodies;
- composer text and form drafts;
- attachment upload progress;
- page filters, selection, expansion, and scroll state;
- device video streams and emulator stream state.

Session detail pages may keep heavy live transcript state local while reporting
useful summary facts into the store.

## Fetch Shape

The store should not imply "fetch the largest endpoint everywhere." Prefer the
smallest endpoint that provides the facts a mounted surface needs, then normalize
that response into the store.

Examples:

- A nav badge that only needs active-agent presence should not permanently need
  full inbox rows if a narrower feed or endpoint exists.
- Project queue badges should read targeted session ids/counts from selectors;
  feed ownership can stay with a mounted `useProjectQueues(projectIds)`.
- Settings can be store-fed from `useServerSettings` snapshots and successful
  mutations even if activity-bus settings events do not exist yet.

Narrow endpoints are optional follow-on work. They should be added when the
current endpoint is measurably wasteful or makes ownership confusing.

## Current Surface Matrix

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sidebar sessions | `useSidebarSessionFeeds` feeds, store selectors render rows | Store selectors for rows, badges, counts; feeds return controls only | Mostly migrated |

| Sidebar queue/draft badges | Queue feed plus store selectors; draft selector | Store selectors | Migrated |
| All Sessions rows | `useGlobalSessionsFeed` plus store query selector | Store query selector | Migrated |
| All Sessions stats/filter options | Feed-local stats/project options from `/api/sessions` | Keep feed-local unless shared elsewhere | Acceptable |
| All Sessions bulk metadata | Direct API calls | Shared mutation helpers that report store updates | Pending |
| Inbox rows | `InboxContext` selects store rows | Direct selectors or compatibility context while feed remains mounted | Mostly migrated |
| Inbox queue/draft badges | Store selectors | Store selectors | Migrated |
| Projects page rows | `useProjects` feeds store project records | Store project selectors | Migrated |
| Projects page active/attention counts | `useInboxCountsByProject()` selector | `useInboxCountsByProject()` selector | Migrated |
| Projects page queue counts | `useProjectQueues` return data | Store queue count selectors | Pending |
| New Session project chooser | `useProjects`, `useProject`, `useRecentSessions` | Store project selectors; possible recent-visit slice | Partial |
| New Session queue visibility | `useActiveProjectSessionIds()` plus queue hook data | active-session and queue selectors by project | Partial |
| Session Page transcript | `useSession`, `useSessionMessages`, streams | Keep local; report summary facts as needed | Keep local |
| Session Page project queue affordances | `useActiveProjectSessionIds()` plus queue hook data | active-session and queue selectors by project | Partial |
| Session Page metadata actions | Direct API calls and local state | Shared mutation helpers that report store updates | Pending |
| Agents nav badge | `useGlobalActiveAgents` wrapper over store selector | Active-agent selector | Migrated |
| Agents page process rows | `useProcesses` polling | Keep feed-local or future `processes` slice | Open |
| Settings pages/hooks | Independent settings hooks | Candidate `settings` slice fed by snapshots/mutations | Open |

## Long-Tail Work Items

### Inbox-Derived Selectors

Priority: High.

Add purpose-built selectors/hooks for facts currently pulled through broad
`useInboxContext`:

- `useInboxCounts()`;
- `useInboxCountsByProject()`;
- `useActiveProjectSessionIds(projectId)`;
- `useHasActiveAgents()` or `useActiveAgentCount()`.

Candidate consumers:

- `AgentsNavItem` / `useGlobalActiveAgents` (migrated);
- `useNeedsAttentionBadge` (migrated);
- Sidebar inbox badge (migrated);
- `ProjectsPage` (migrated);
- `NewSessionForm` (migrated for active session ids);
- `SessionPage` (migrated for active session ids).

Expected result: fewer independent `api.getInbox()` calls and fewer broad
context subscriptions for components that only need counts or ids.

### Project Queue Selector Cleanup

Priority: High.

`useProjectQueues(projectIds)` should remain a feed/mutation hook, but UI should
avoid relying on its returned row data for shared display facts when a selector
can express the same thing.

Useful selectors:

- queue item count by project;
- blocking/visible queue item count by project;
- targeted existing-session ids by project;
- queue presence for a single session.

Candidate consumers:

- Sidebar;
- All Sessions;
- Inbox;
- Projects page;
- New Session;
- Session Page.

### Metadata And Seen Mutation Helpers

Priority: Medium.

Several surfaces call session metadata/read APIs directly:

- `SessionListItem`;
- `GlobalSessionsPage` bulk actions;
- `SessionPage` title/star/archive/read actions;
- engagement/read tracking hooks.

Introduce shared client action helpers for successful mutations:

- update session metadata and report `session-metadata-changed`;
- mark session seen and report store unread state;
- mark session unread and report store unread state, if no activity-bus event
  exists for that path;
- project add/delete helpers that report project-list changes when possible.

Expected result: all shared surfaces update immediately after successful local
actions, without waiting for a later REST snapshot.

### Settings Slice

Priority: Medium-low.

Settings are coarse, shared, and consistency-sensitive enough to belong in the
client summary store eventually. They are lower urgency than live session data
because they change less often and are not currently activity-bus fed.

Candidate state:

- server settings;
- client defaults;
- model/voice/display defaults that multiple surfaces read;
- version/capability-gated settings values only if they are summary-like.

Feed ownership can initially stay with existing hooks such as
`useServerSettings`. Successful settings mutations should report the accepted
response into the store. Activity-bus settings events can remain a later
enhancement if cross-tab settings drift becomes visible.

### Recent Visits

Priority: Low-medium.

`useRecentSessions` returns enriched recent-visit rows for New Session project
selection. This is conceptually a membership list plus session/project summary
facts.

Possible target:

- a `recentVisits` slice stores ordered visit ids and timestamps;
- selectors compose visit membership with session/project records;
- the existing `recordSessionVisit` helper reports local successful visits.

Keep this lower priority unless the enriched recent rows start diverging from
session/project summaries in visible UI.

### Agents And Processes

Priority: Open.

`useProcesses` returns process rows for the Agents page. This is adjacent to
session summary data but not identical to it.

Options:

- leave `useProcesses` as a process feed and make only the nav badge read from
  inbox/session selectors;
- add a separate `processes` slice if Agents page data needs to compose with
  Sidebar, Projects, or Session Page in more places.

Do not force process rows into `sessions` unless the fields are stable session
summary facts.

### Retire Obsolete Local Status Hooks

Priority: Low.

`useSessionStatuses` appears to duplicate activity/unread status tracking that
the summary store now owns. If it has no production consumers, remove it. If a
consumer appears, migrate that consumer to session-summary selectors first.

## First Recommended Chunk

Replace broad inbox context consumers with purpose selectors:

1. [x] Add reducer/selectors/hooks for inbox counts, counts by project, and
   active session ids by project.
2. [x] Migrate `useGlobalActiveAgents` or replace it at `AgentsNavItem`.
3. [x] Migrate `useNeedsAttentionBadge` and Sidebar inbox badge.
4. [x] Migrate `ProjectsPage`, `NewSessionForm`, and `SessionPage` from
   `useInboxContext` row arrays to targeted selectors.
5. [x] Keep `InboxContext` as the fetch/lifecycle provider and compatibility
   layer for `InboxContent`.

This is the highest-value cleanup because it removes duplicate inbox fetching
and narrows several consumers that currently subscribe to full inbox row arrays.

## Progress Log

- 2026-06-28: Created this tracker after the Zustand client summary store,
  project slice, project queue slice, draft decorations, nested `sessions`
  shape, and Inbox tier migration landed. Remaining work is long-tail
  migration, selector narrowing, and optional new slices rather than store
  substrate work.
- 2026-06-28: Added targeted inbox selector hooks for counts, per-project
  counts, active project session ids, and active-agent presence. Migrated
  `useGlobalActiveAgents`, `useNeedsAttentionBadge`, and the Sidebar inbox
  badge off broad `useInboxContext` consumption; `ProjectsPage`,
  `NewSessionForm`, and `SessionPage` still need the project-scoped selector
  migration.
- 2026-06-28: Migrated the project-scoped inbox consumers. `ProjectsPage`
  now reads per-project inbox counts from the client summary store, while
  `NewSessionForm` and `SessionPage` use active project session id selectors
  for Project Queue visibility. The remaining `useInboxContext` production
  consumer is `InboxContent`, with `InboxContext` still owning the `/api/inbox`
  feed.
- 2026-06-28: Paused further long-tail migration behind the source-registry
  prerequisite in `027-client-summary-source-registry.md`. The next store
  substrate change keeps the current `ClientSummaryState` shape but creates
  one cache per backend source so hosted remote host switches cannot render
  sessions from the previous machine.

## Verification Checklist

For each long-tail chunk:

- feed hooks do not publish authoritative empty snapshots before remote
  readiness;
- successful local mutations update store-backed surfaces immediately;
- stale REST snapshots cannot undo newer events or local successful actions;
- hot list rows do not subscribe to the whole store when a narrower selector is
  practical;
- tests cover unchanged record identity or selected-hook render isolation when
  a chunk touches hot row surfaces;
- no transcript/message/composer state moves into the global store.

## Immediate Next Chunk

Implement the client summary source registry from
[`027-client-summary-source-registry.md`](027-client-summary-source-registry.md)
before continuing queue selector cleanup or settings migration.

Reason: moving more surfaces onto an unscoped singleton store would increase
the blast radius of the multi-host leakage bug. The registry keeps the current
`ClientSummaryState` shape but creates one store per backend source, so the
existing selector migration can continue without mixing MacBook, WinNative, Pi,
or local summaries.
