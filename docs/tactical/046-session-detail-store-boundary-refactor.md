# Session Detail Store Boundary Refactor

Topic: session-detail-data-layer

Status: Boundary phases and the behavior-preserving module split are
implemented. Zustand was evaluated and deferred. This follows the current-state
audit in
[`045-session-detail-store-current-state-audit.md`](045-session-detail-store-current-state-audit.md).

## Goal

Split the current singleton `SessionDetailStore` shape into a clearer cache
manager plus one session-detail entry store per cache key, without changing
session-detail behavior.

The cleanup target is:

```text
SessionDetailCache
  owns keys, lookup, creation, retain/release, eviction, stats

SessionDetailEntry
  owns key metadata, retain/accounting metadata, one entry store

SessionDetailEntryStore
  owns SessionDetailState, reducer dispatch, selectors, notifications
```

This is not intended to canonicalize all windows for one session. The first
refactor keeps the current cache unit:

```text
sourceKey + projectId + sessionId + tailTurns/tailFrom
```

That means "one entry store per session window", not a broader "one canonical
store per session" model.

## Why This Is Worth Doing

The current code works, but `SessionDetailStore` is doing two jobs:

- cache manager: source/window keying, mounted ownership, retention, TTL,
  byte-budget eviction, stats;
- entry store: per-entry `SessionDetailState`, reducer dispatch, selected
  reads, selected subscriptions, notification equality.

Separating those jobs gives future readers and agents a simpler mental model:

- a route retains one explicit entry key;
- one entry owns one transcript-window state;
- the cache manager owns memory and lifetime;
- any future Zustand decision is scoped to entry-store mechanics only.

This is bigger than a pure rename because cache ownership moves out of the
entry state container, but it should be smaller and safer than changing the
transcript-window semantics.

## Non-Goals

- Do not merge `tailTurns`, `tailFrom`, and default windows into one canonical
  per-session transcript store.
- Do not change warm-cache reveal behavior.
- Do not change compacted-tail refresh behavior.
- Do not change older-page pagination semantics.
- Do not move token-sized streaming or scroll ticks into broad React
  subscriptions.
- Do not replace the entry-store implementation with Zustand in the same patch
  that extracts the cache manager.
- Do not retire `sessionRouteSnapshots` until the manager boundary is explicit.

## Working Decisions

- **Entry identity:** use explicit session-window terminology. A likely name is
  `SessionDetailEntryKey`; if the code needs stronger emphasis on tail variants,
  consider `SessionDetailWindowKey`.
- **Window variants:** preserve independent entries for default, `tailTurns`,
  and `tailFrom`.
- **Mounted ownership:** preserve current behavior where a mounted route is
  protected before load. The new API should make route ownership distinct from
  loaded transcript data.
- **Scroll snapshots:** keep them associated with the entry key for this
  refactor and preserve non-notifying patch behavior.
- **Diagnostics:** keep aggregate `getStats()` on the cache manager.
- **Zustand:** evaluated after the cache/entry boundary landed and deferred.
  If reconsidered later, it should only back `SessionDetailEntryStore`, not the
  cache registry.

## Proposed API Shape

Names can change during implementation, but the boundary should stay clear:

```ts
interface SessionDetailCache {
  retain(key: SessionDetailEntryKey): () => void;
  read(key: SessionDetailEntryKey): SessionDetailState | undefined;
  readRouteSnapshot(key: SessionDetailEntryKey): SessionRouteSnapshot | undefined;
  readSelected<T>(
    key: SessionDetailEntryKey,
    selector: (state: SessionDetailState) => T,
  ): T | undefined;
  dispatch(
    key: SessionDetailEntryKey,
    action: SessionDetailAction,
  ): SessionDetailState | undefined;
  writeRouteSnapshot(
    key: SessionDetailEntryKey,
    snapshot: SessionRouteSnapshot,
  ): boolean;
  patchScrollSnapshot(
    key: SessionDetailEntryKey,
    snapshot: SessionRouteScrollSnapshot,
    options?: { notify?: boolean },
  ): void;
  subscribe<T>(
    key: SessionDetailEntryKey,
    selector: (state: SessionDetailState | undefined) => T,
    listener: () => void,
    equality?: (left: T, right: T) => boolean,
  ): () => void;
  deleteEntry(key: SessionDetailEntryKey): boolean;
  evictExpired(): number;
  clear(): void;
  getStats(): SessionDetailStoreStats;
}
```

The initial extraction can keep this compatibility surface so
`useSessionMessages` and `sessionRouteSnapshots` do not change at the same time
as the internal split.

## Phase 1: Name The Cache Key

Status: Implemented.

Intent:

- Introduce explicit entry-key naming around `SessionDetailEntryKeyInput` and
  `getSessionDetailEntryKey`.
- Keep existing exports as aliases if needed for compatibility.
- Update tests and nearby docs to say "entry" or "session window" where that is
  the real concept.

Acceptance:

- No behavior changes.
- Existing store and hook tests pass.
- A reader can tell from names that the key is source/session/window scoped.

Implementation note:

- Added `SessionDetailEntryKeyInput` and `getSessionDetailEntryKey`, while
  keeping `SessionDetailStoreKeyInput` and `getSessionDetailStoreKey` as
  compatibility aliases.
- Updated `sessionRouteSnapshots` and direct store tests to prefer the
  entry-key names.

## Phase 2: Extract Per-Entry Object

Status: Implemented.

Intent:

- Introduce a private `SessionDetailEntry` object that owns one entry's state,
  selected subscriptions, dispatch, scroll patch, and route snapshot conversion.
- Keep retain/accounting metadata either on `SessionDetailEntry` or in an
  adjacent cache-owned record, but do not leave per-entry state buried directly
  in the manager map.
- Preserve current notification behavior, especially selector equality and
  non-notifying scroll patches.

Acceptance:

- Direct store tests still pass.
- Metadata-only store updates still do not rerender returned transcript data.
- Missing-entry incremental actions are still dropped.

Implementation note:

- Added a private `SessionDetailEntry` object that owns one entry's
  `SessionDetailState`, selected subscriptions, notification equality, dispatch
  state replacement, scroll patching, reset, and stats projection.
- Preserved subscription-before-load behavior by allowing subscription-only
  entry slots that do not count as retained/cached records.
- Kept retention, eviction, aggregate byte accounting, and public singleton APIs
  on the outer `SessionDetailStore`; those remain Phase 3 cache-manager work.

## Phase 3: Extract Cache Manager Responsibilities

Status: Implemented.

Intent:

- Make the outer type visibly own lookup, creation, delete, retain/release,
  TTL, byte-budget eviction, and aggregate stats.
- Keep the public singleton name stable if it reduces churn, but make internal
  names reflect cache-manager versus entry-store roles.
- Keep byte accounting and deduped aggregate accounting on the manager side.

Acceptance:

- Mounted entries remain protected from expiry/eviction.
- Cache-disabled unmount deletes the active entry.
- Cache-enabled unmount releases but preserves a cacheable snapshot.
- Budget-zero settings still clear retained snapshots.
- `getStats()` remains useful for diagnostics and tests.

Implementation note:

- Added a private `SessionDetailCache` manager that owns entry lookup, creation,
  delete, retain/release, TTL eviction, LRU/byte eviction, and aggregate stats.
- Kept exported `SessionDetailStore` as the stable compatibility facade over
  that cache, so hook and route snapshot callers did not move in this phase.
- Split per-entry data into `SessionDetailEntry` metadata plus
  `SessionDetailEntryStore` reducer/subscription state. This leaves each entry
  with one session-window store while the cache owns lifecycle and diagnostics.

## Phase 4: Compatibility Facade Cleanup

Status: Implemented.

Intent:

- Review `sessionRouteSnapshots` after the cache manager is explicit.
- Either keep it as a named compatibility layer or rename/collapse callers onto
  clearer cache APIs.

Acceptance:

- Route snapshot read/write behavior is unchanged.
- Warm restore, source scoping, and cache-disabled behavior remain covered.

Implementation note:

- Moved active `useSessionMessages` cache reads/writes from
  `sessionRouteSnapshots` helpers onto `defaultSessionDetailStore` directly,
  while preserving the transcript-cache enabled check and SSR guard.
- Removed the duplicate scroll-snapshot patch that existed because the old
  route-snapshot cache had been merged into the detail store.
- Updated the budget-zero performance-settings clear path and its test to use
  `defaultSessionDetailStore.clear()` directly.
- Kept `sessionRouteSnapshots` as the serializable snapshot DTO module and
  documented its remaining functions as a legacy compatibility surface.

## Phase 5: Optional Entry Store Substrate Spike

Status: Evaluated / Deferred.

Intent:

- Evaluate whether each `SessionDetailEntryStore` should use
  `zustand/vanilla`.
- Measure whether it deletes bespoke subscription code without weakening cache
  ownership or notification semantics.

Acceptance for adopting Zustand:

- The cache manager remains custom and owns entry registry, retention, eviction,
  and stats.
- Per-entry selected subscriptions are at least as narrow as today.
- Scroll snapshot patches can remain non-notifying for returned transcript
  subscribers.
- Bundle/dependency impact remains acceptable.

Decision:

- Do not replace `SessionDetailEntryStore` with `zustand/vanilla` in this
  series. After the boundary cleanup, the candidate surface is a small leaf
  state holder plus selector subscriptions, while the hard lifecycle logic
  remains correctly custom in `SessionDetailCache`.
- A Zustand version would need `subscribeWithSelector` and still needs special
  handling for non-notifying scroll snapshot patches. Preserving that behavior
  would either keep custom code around the store or introduce out-of-band state
  mutation, which weakens the readability argument.
- Revisit only if per-entry stores become direct React stores, or if
  `SessionDetailEntryStore` grows enough that standard Zustand mechanics would
  remove meaningful code rather than mostly rename it.

## Phase 6: Split Store Modules

Status: Implemented.

Intent:

- Split `sessionDetailStore.ts` into smaller internal modules now that the
  cache, entry metadata, entry store, and public facade boundaries are clear.
- Preserve the public import surface for hook callers and compatibility helpers.
- Keep behavior unchanged; this is a readability and reviewability cleanup.

Proposed file shape:

```text
sessionDetail/
  sessionDetailStore.ts          public facade and exported defaults
  sessionDetailCache.ts          cache manager, retention, eviction, stats
  sessionDetailEntry.ts          entry metadata and lifecycle wrapper
  sessionDetailEntryStore.ts     leaf state, selectors, notifications
  sessionDetailKey.ts            entry key input and key encoder
  sessionDetailSnapshots.ts      route snapshot conversion helpers
  sessionDetailRetention.ts      retention defaults/configuration helpers
```

Acceptance:

- Existing public exports from `sessionDetailStore.ts` remain available.
- No behavior changes in direct store, hook cache, performance-settings, or
  route-snapshot compatibility tests.
- `sessionDetailStore.ts` becomes a small facade/export file rather than the
  implementation owner.

Implementation note:

- Split the monolithic store implementation into key, retention, snapshot
  conversion, entry-store, entry, and cache modules.
- Kept `sessionDetailStore.ts` as the public facade and compatibility export
  surface for existing callers.
- Preserved the existing direct store, hook cache, performance-settings, and
  route-snapshot compatibility test coverage.

## Potential Further Refactors

These are deliberately separate from the module split because they could change
semantics or test obligations.

- **Move retention metadata fully cache-side:** keep `retainCount`, timestamps,
  expiry, and byte size in cache-owned records rather than `SessionDetailEntry`.
  This would make `SessionDetailEntry` closer to a pure state store but may add
  indirection in stats and eviction.
- **Introduce a typed entry handle:** have `retain()` return an object with
  `release()`, key metadata, and maybe debug stats. This can make ownership more
  legible than a bare release callback, but would touch hook ergonomics.
- **Completed 2026-07-03 — separate scroll snapshot state:** scroll snapshots
  now live at the cache-entry boundary instead of in `SessionDetailState`, so
  non-reactive scroll memory is structurally separate from reducer-owned
  transcript/session state. The follow-on scroll policy work is tracked in
  [047-session-scroll-memory-policy.md](047-session-scroll-memory-policy.md).
- **Promote snapshot conversion into a local adapter:** isolate
  `SessionRouteSnapshot` conversion from reducer state so cache and route DTO
  boundaries are explicit. The module split can prepare this without changing
  behavior.
- **Canonical per-session store:** unify default/tail windows under one
  `source/project/session` store and derive requested windows from it. This is
  a larger semantic design, not a cleanup, because it changes compacted-tail,
  pagination, and cache-restore behavior.

## Tests To Preserve

Before and after each implementation phase, run focused coverage for:

- `packages/client/src/lib/sessionDetail/__tests__/sessionDetailStore.test.ts`
- `packages/client/src/hooks/__tests__/useSessionMessages.cache.test.tsx`
- `packages/client/src/hooks/__tests__/useSessionPerformanceSettings.test.ts`
- `packages/client/src/lib/sessionDetail/__tests__/transcriptReducer.test.ts`
- `packages/client/src/components/__tests__/MessageList.test.tsx`

For implementation phases touching hook behavior, also run the project lint and
typecheck wrappers before landing.

## Open Follow-Up: Canonical Per-Session Store

A later, separate design could try to make one canonical store per
`source/project/session` and derive requested windows from it. That is
intentionally out of scope here because it would change the semantics around:

- compacted-tail initial loads;
- retained broader windows versus requested tail windows;
- older-page expansion;
- pagination fields such as returned versus total counts;
- route-cache restore behavior.

The boundary refactor should make that future design easier, but should not
enact it.
