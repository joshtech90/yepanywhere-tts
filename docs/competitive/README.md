## Third-Party Tools (Agent Supervisors)

| Tool | Type | Agents | Key Differentiator |
|------|------|--------|-------------------|
| [Warp](warp.md) | Native desktop terminal + browser/mobile Remote Control | Warp Agent; 15 advertised local CLIs; Claude/Codex cloud harnesses | Direct local-agent remote supervision, attention mailbox, forks, review, hosted/self-hosted execution and adjacent Factories |
| [T3 Code](t3code.md) | Web + desktop + native mobile | Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, OpenCode, Antigravity | Integrated workbench, offline mobile, multi-environment remote access, full source-control workflow |
| [bb](bb.md) | Web + desktop + early-access mobile shell | Claude, Codex, Pi, five named ACP agents + custom ACP | Extensible plugin workbench, durable workflows, scheduling, managed environments and multi-host execution |

## Android hosts and platform references

The [Android host topic](../../topics/android-host.md) owns YA's runtime,
optional ADB direction, distribution assessment and research-only assistant
entry-point exploration. The 2026-10-18 reviews below use pinned source, with
no app installation, device investigation or assistant spike.

| Project | Role | Research focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Buddy](buddy.md) | Phone-local provider runtime and assistant | Alpine/PRoot, native phone tools, provider sign-in, APK updates and restricted Play flavor |
| [Shizuku](shizuku.md) | Adjacent Android privilege broker | User-enabled ADB/root service, Binder authorization, wireless setup, lifecycle and rish |
| [Termux](termux.md) | Adjacent terminal/development environment | Upstream versus Play builds, native execution, system-linker wrapper, package provenance and PRoot |

The [reference map](android-host-references.md) and
[YAML pins](android-host-references.yaml) bind the nine local research
checkouts to exact commits. These are source-reading references, not adopted
runtime dependencies or evidence of YA store approval.

## Adjacent: Version Control And Multiplayer Threads

**[Multiplayer AI and collaborative live sessions](multiplayer-ai.md)** —
2026-09-30 product review of HumanLayer, Delta, Coshell, mpai, Slack Code, and
YC activity; distinguishes shared conversations from shared projects and records
permission boundaries, open-source status, and relevance to YA's proposals.
A dated October 17 follow-up adds Happy's implemented shared-server team mode
and its broad access/membership-management limits.

| Product | Type | Key Differentiator |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| [Zed DeltaDB / Delta](deltadb.md) | Public beta; no public Delta source verified | Operation-level history with edits linked to conversation, delta-anchored comments, mid-run branches, live multi-person threads |

Not an agent supervisor, but it overlaps YA on code↔conversation provenance,
forking, and shared sessions; the review names the YA sketches it motivates.

## The "Claw" Ecosystem (Adjacent Category)

"Claw" is now a recognized category term (Karpathy coined it, Willison validated it, Feb 2026) for AI agents that run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging, and schedule autonomous tasks. These are **runtimes that wrap LLM APIs**, not agent supervisors like yepanywhere. But they overlap enough to track.

| Project | Stars | Language | Key Differentiator |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | 215k | TypeScript | The original. 38+ channels, 5,700+ skills on ClawHub |
| [Nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | 22.4k | Python | ~4K lines. Research-friendly. MCP integration |
| [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) | 17.2k | Go | <10MB RAM, runs on $10 RISC-V boards |
| [ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) | 16k | Rust | <5MB RAM, single binary, 22+ providers |
| [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) | 10.2k | TypeScript | Container isolation (Docker/Apple Container) |
| [Moltworker](https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker) | 8.6k | TypeScript | Serverless on Cloudflare Workers |
| [IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) | 2.6k | Rust | WASM sandboxing, PostgreSQL, defense-in-depth |

**Why we're different:** Claws are runtimes — they manage LLM API calls, tool execution, and session state. We're a supervisor/relay — we manage existing agents (Claude Code, Codex) that handle their own execution. See the [Seneschal competitive analysis](../../../assistant-data/assistants/scout/docs/seneschal-ideas.md) for detailed positioning.

## Common Features Across Competitors

Most tools in this space provide:
- Multi-session dashboard
- Real-time streaming
- Permission approval UI
- Session persistence

## yepanywhere Differentiators

The combination that most clearly distinguishes yepanywhere:

- **Tiered inbox** (Needs Attention → Active → Recent → Unread) across
  YA-owned and externally discovered provider sessions
- **Conversation fork/clone** from a selected completed user turn
- **Provider-native history discovery** rather than a product-only thread silo
- **Global activity stream** across sessions
- **Reload-safe provider runtimes** that can survive a Hono server replacement
- **App-data-only storage by default** — browsing and indexing do not create
  project directories or Git refs
- **Application-layer E2E relay encryption** (Happy and Paseo also use E2E;
  T3 Connect and CosmoRemote do not appear to)
- **Alternate/local provider variants** including Codex OSS/local, Gemini, and
  Claude gateway/Ollama configurations

These describe a combination, not individually unique capabilities. The
[bb source review](bb.md) confirms conversation forks, daemon-owned execution
and remote access there too. Against bb, emphasize provider-native history,
the tiered inbox, application-layer E2E relay encryption, and native Windows
support; bb currently requires WSL2 on Windows.

The [Warp source review](warp.md) also confirms local-agent Remote Control,
attention notifications, earlier-turn native conversation forks and native
Claude/Codex transcript capture for managed runs. Against Warp, emphasize
external provider-history discovery, the server-wide session inbox and the
encrypted authenticated relay boundary. Warp's published session content is
uploaded to its service; its open execution worker does not replace the hosted
control plane.

The [Happy review](happy.md) now confirms daemon-owned execution, worktrees,
mixed-model orchestration and human multiplayer. Against Happy, distinguish
YA's provider-owned runtimes and native history from Happy's recreated
execution harness; do not reuse the February process/worktree absence claims.

## Common Gaps

Features competitors have that we should consider:

- **Git worktree creation and exact workspace rollback** per session
- **Integrated terminal/browser and full forge workflows** (T3 Code)
- **Native mobile store distribution** (T3 Code, Happy, CosmoRemote)
- **Offline mobile outbox** (T3 Code)
- **Phone-driven simulator build/test loop** (CosmoRemote)
- **Multiple provider-account instances** with explicit resume rules (T3 Code)
- **Scheduling/automations** (Codex App, AionUi)
- **Durable agent workflows and a general workbench plugin SDK** (bb)
- **Messaging platform bots** as mobile proxy (AionUi — Telegram/Lark/DingTalk)

## Related (Non-Competitive)

See **[Ecosystem](../ecosystem/)** for adjacent projects — agent-to-agent coordination, workflow DAG platforms, multi-agent orchestrators — that aren't direct competitors but operate in complementary spaces.
