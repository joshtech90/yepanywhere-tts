 * Pricing recorded token usage: what a set of token counts cost, and the same

 *
 * Contract: topics/limited-users.md § Delivery v1 — Usage.
 *
 * The two numbers are one calculation. Dollars come from a per-model price
 * table; the output-token equivalent is those dollars divided by the one
 * constant that model charges per output token. So the equivalent is exactly
 * "what this would have cost as plain generation on this model", and the dollar
 * figure is a supplement to it rather than a separate estimate that could
 * disagree.
 *
 * Why the equivalent leads: a model's prices change, and a report that reads in
 * output tokens keeps meaning the same thing when they do. Dollars are what the
 * table happened to say when the report was drawn.
 *
 * Two price sources, in order. `PUBLISHED_MODEL_PRICES` below is read from the
 * providers' own pricing pages on a stated date, and covers the models YA
 * launches that the vendored table does not name. The vendored extract of pi's
 * table backs it up for everything else. Neither is authoritative for long: see
 * gaps/usage-cost-price-table.md.
