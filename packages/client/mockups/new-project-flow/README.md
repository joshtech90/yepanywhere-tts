# New project from New session

Static proposal (2026-10-08) for making **New project** the one entry point
for a folder YA has not seen, with **Empty folder** as a peer of the template
choices. Typing an unused path into the project search opens the same panel,
replacing today's separate "Use typed path" row. Five states: pick existing,
new project (empty folder, optional Git init), new project from a template,
typed unused path, and problems (missing parent; one `mkdir`, never `-p`).

This is a single HTML file with values copied from the dark theme in
`src/styles/index.css`. It does not mount the real form, and nothing in it
creates folders or sessions. A typed path already creates one folder (a
missing parent is refused, except under a limited user's project root) and
always runs `git init` with an empty first commit
(`packages/server/src/routes/project-creation.ts`). The new server piece is
making that Git step optional; the "Create ~/work too" offer would also need
an explicit request flag.

Capture one state (the tab label's number selects it):

```sh
printf 'export default async ({ page }) => { await page.getByRole("tab", { name: /2 ·/ }).click(); };\n' > /tmp/state.mjs
pnpm -s artifact:capture packages/client/mockups/new-project-flow/index.html \
  --interact /tmp/state.mjs --ready-selector '[data-ready]' --json
```
