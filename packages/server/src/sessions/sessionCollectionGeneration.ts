/**
 * A monotonic revision covering every input a global session collection reads.
 *
 * `GET /api/sessions` walks every project, lists every project's sessions, and
 * enriches each row from session metadata, notification read state, supervisor
 * ownership, external-process tracking, and workstream membership. A client
 * that already holds the rows has no cheap way to ask "is any of that
 * different?", so every tab's every revalidation repeats the whole walk.
 *
 * This counter answers that question. It is deliberately *coarse*: one number
 * for the whole collection, bumped by any event that could change any rendered
 * row. `topics/session-catalog-observation.md` explains why the durable catalog
 * splits its generation into a per-shard vector instead — a per-project query
 * should not be invalidated by a write in another project. That reasoning does
 * not apply here, because the unfiltered global list genuinely depends on every
 * project; a `project=` filtered read is the case a future vector component
 * would serve, and it is left for measurement rather than added speculatively.
 *
 * **The event test is a deny-list on purpose.** Anything not proven unable to
 * change a row invalidates. A new `BusEvent` variant added later therefore
 * defaults to correct-but-conservative rather than silently serving stale rows,
 * which is the failure a conditional response makes invisible.
