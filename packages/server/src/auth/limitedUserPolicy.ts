/**
 * What a limited user may ask the API to do.
 *
 * Contract: topics/limited-users.md § Delivery v1 — Authorization.
 *
 * The rule is default-deny: a request path that is not listed here is
 * refused, so a route added later is unreachable for limited users until
 * someone lists it deliberately. Listed paths are then scoped — a project or
 * session outside the user's grants answers 404 rather than 403, because
 * whether a project exists is itself not the user's business.
 *
 * This module is pure: it decides from the method and the path, and hands
 * back what the caller must still resolve (a session's project). The path
 * must be the one the router matches handlers against (Hono's `c.req.path`,
 * already percent-decoded), never the raw URL pathname: `/api/%69ssues`
 * reaches the `/api/issues` handler, so the decision has to see it as that.
 *
 * A project grant comes only from the path. No route is opened by a
 * `projectId` query parameter, because most handlers ignore one.
