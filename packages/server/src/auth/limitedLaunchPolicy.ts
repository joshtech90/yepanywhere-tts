/**
 * Launch policy every process a limited user starts must obey.
 *
 * Contract: topics/limited-users.md § Delivery v1 and § Execution boundary.
 *
 * This is the one owner of what a limited user may launch, applied at every
 * route that starts or resumes a provider process on their behalf and at
 * Project Queue dispatch. Routes that would launch without it are refused by
 * the route policy (auth/limitedUserPolicy.ts) rather than left open.
 *
 * - The session runs sandboxed, network firewall included. A new session is
 *   forced to `project-write` with the firewall on, and a request that
 *   explicitly turns the firewall off is refused; an existing session must
 *   already run that way, since its boundary was settled when it was created
 *   and a limited user may not drive an unsandboxed process.
 * - It runs on this host: a remote executor and computer control are outside
 *   any sandbox, so either one is refused.
 * - A locked provider, model, or effort is applied. A request naming a value
 *   that conflicts with the lock is refused rather than quietly overridden,
 *   so a stale client cannot believe it launched what it asked for.
