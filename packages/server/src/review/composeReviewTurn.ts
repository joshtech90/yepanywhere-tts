/**
 * Compose the seeded review turn (topic: source-review-to-session).
 *
 * The delivered turn is a short prompt: it names what this is, tells the agent
 * to address each comment and report per-comment dispositions, and — crucially
 * — instructs it to read current file state rather than trust the quoted
 * snippets. The structured comments travel by reference in the project-local
 * the storage-policy-selected review file; each comment also carries a small inline snippet
 * for human readability and immediate context.
 *
 * A SHA is cited only when relocation failed (the line is gone) or the comment
 * is on the removed side — the lean-turn rule. A successfully relocated line
 * gives path + current line + snippet; the agent can blame it if it wants
 * provenance. Pure string composition — no I/O.
