# Android control instrumentation is not reliably repeatable

On the owned API 35 emulator, the minified ordinary suite after the system-bar
repair failed `WebClientActivityTest.nativeHostDoesNotReplyToASubframe`: the
injected iframe's load marker stayed `pending` for ten seconds, before the
no-privileged-subframe-reply assertion. A focused rerun passed in 2.51 seconds.
This installation had already completed actual-Release pairing and still
retained its disposable host/profile; it was not an empty-app-state run. The
exact iframe failure cause is unresolved. The later clean-state suite passes
all 18 executable cases (25 fixture-dependent assumptions).
Do not weaken the security assertion or increase the timeout without diagnosis.

Repeating the entire suite on the same installation also reproduced the existing
[notification-permission reset defect](android-notification-test-revocation-kills-runner.md):
Android kills the instrumentation process when its helper revokes an already
granted permission. That entry owns the repair. Clearing only the owned
emulator's disposable test app data is the current clean-run preparation;
never do that on a user's phone.

Both failed logs are retained in `tasks/android-hardening-round2/`. Neither
failure is evidence of connection regression or a standard web defect. Keep
this bounded test-isolation work separate from the native appearance repair;
CI still runs the assertions without retries on its fresh emulator.

Found 2026-10-08 during final Release/system-bar verification.
