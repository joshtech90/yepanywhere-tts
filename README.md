A complete browser interface for Claude Code and Codex. Start and supervise
agents from another computer, a tablet, or a phone while they run on the
machines you control.

Use an eligible Claude or ChatGPT plan through the account already signed in to
the official provider tool. Yep Anywhere can also show current subscription
limits when the provider exposes them.

## Features

- **All your sessions, in one place** — Find and resume every Claude Code and
  Codex session, including those started from CLIs, VS Code, and first-party
  desktop apps. Disconnect or switch devices without interrupting active work.
- **See the whole session** — Follow the complete conversation, tool calls, and
  available thinking, or use a condensed view when you only need the result.
- **Work comfortably from a phone** — Approve tools, answer questions, upload
  files and photos, use voice input, and receive attention notifications.
- **Keep many agents organized** — See every project in one inbox, watch
  activity across sessions, steer active work, queue follow-ups, search older
  sessions, catch up with recaps, and fork or clone conversations.
- **Review and ship** — Browse files, diffs, and blame; send line comments to an
  agent; check remotes, fast-forward pull, push, or share a session read-only.
- **Control test devices remotely** — Stream Android devices and Apple
  Simulators with touch controls and adaptive quality.
- **Connect your way** — Use a direct connection or the end-to-end encrypted
  public relay, with no device pairing, VPN, or port forwarding required for
  the relay path.

See the [complete feature catalog](https://yepanywhere.com/features) and
[public documentation](https://yepanywhere.com/docs) for availability and setup.

## Getting Started

If you can install Claude Code or Codex, you can install this. The runtime has a
narrow dependency surface.

**Desktop apps (beta):** Signed macOS and Windows installers are
available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/releases).
They are available now while release-readiness work continues.

**npm (established path):**

```
npm i -g yepanywhere
yepanywhere
```

Or, from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere.git
cd yepanywhere
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Open http://localhost:3400 in your browser. The app auto-detects installed CLI agents.

The complete phone and tablet experience is the responsive browser client. A
native app should add more than an app-store wrapper, so Android is in
development around reliable background notifications, deep links, trusted
packaging, and a multi-server inbox, with iOS planned afterward. Neither is
published. Follow the
[getting-started guide](https://yepanywhere.com/docs/getting-started) for the
current platform choices.

## Updating

For the npm-global install:

```bash
npm update -g yepanywhere
```

Then restart `yepanywhere`.

For a source checkout:

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Then restart the server with `pnpm start`.

## Remote Access

**Easiest:** Use our free public relay when you want passworded,
end-to-end encrypted access from any browser. Configure it in Settings, or via
CLI for headless setups:

```bash
yepanywhere --setup-remote-access --username myserver --password "secretpass123"
```

Then connect from anywhere at [yepanywhere.com/remote](https://yepanywhere.com/remote).

Remote Access application traffic is end-to-end encrypted, so the relay
cannot read session contents. Public session shares are a separate opt-in path:
the current relay operator can read shared content. No accounts are required.

**Private network:** If you only need to reach a solo install from your phone,
a VPN such as Tailscale is usually simpler than deploying your own relay: put
the phone and dev machine on the same private network, then open the Yep
Anywhere server from the phone.

**Self-hosted web access:** Prefer to run your own public infrastructure? Use
Caddy or any reverse proxy with SSL termination. See the
[remote access guide](https://yepanywhere.com/docs/remote-access) for details.

## Why not just use the terminal?

You *can* use the terminal on your phone — but monospace text is painful on a small screen, there's no file upload, no push notifications, and no way to see all your sessions at once. This gives you a proper UI while keeping everything self-hosted and running your code locally.

## Comparison to Other Tools

There are a lot of projects in this space. We track them all: **[docs/competitive/all-projects.md](docs/competitive/all-projects.md)**

## Development

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for build instructions, configuration
options, and contributor guidance. For deeper technical context, see the
[project architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[client rendering and performance guide](packages/client/RENDERING_PERFORMANCE.md).

## TOS Compliance

Yep Anywhere uses the official [`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk) published by Anthropic. We don't handle authentication, spoof headers, or manipulate OAuth tokens. You authenticate via your own Claude CLI — we're just a remote interface to your sessions.
