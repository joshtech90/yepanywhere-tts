# Rich-Text Rendering

> Rendering pipeline for agent action panels and file previews, including when
> YA turns raw provider text into sanitized markdown, syntax-highlighted code,
> local file links, media previews, and diff views.

Covers the rendering pipeline for agent action panels — what transforms apply to
command output, file reads, diffs, and edits; which are always-on vs. user-toggleable;
and the rationale for each choice.

## Panel types

| Panel | Where rendered | Source data |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Bash output** | `BashCollapsedPreview` / expand | stdout + stderr from tool result |
| **Read — code file** | `TextFileResult` → `FileModalContent` | `_highlightedContentHtml` from server (Shiki) |
| **Read — markdown file** | `TextFileResult` → `FileModalContent` | `_renderedMarkdownHtml` from server |
| **Read — plain text / log** | `TextFileResult` → `FileModalContent` | raw `file.content` |
| **Edit diff** | `EditCollapsedPreview` → `DiffMathView` | unified-diff string |
| **Diff nested in Bash output** | `BashCollapsedPreview` → `FixedFontMathToggle` | detected via `looksLikeUnifiedDiff` |

## Thinking block formatting

Thinking blocks are user-visible model reasoning summaries, not normal assistant
prose and not tool output. They may arrive while streaming, so YA keeps their
renderer deliberately smaller than the assistant Markdown path: cheap line-level
transforms only, with no whole-document Markdown reparse requirement.

Current thinking rendering activates an outline view only when the first line is
a standalone `**heading**`. Subsequent standalone `**heading**` lines become
collapsible outline sections; a blank line immediately after a heading is
suppressed so the visual grouping follows the heading/body structure. Inline
backtick spans and fenced or indented fixed-font blocks get monospace treatment.
Non-code lines that are only an HTML comment are treated as display placeholders
and suppressed; comment-like lines inside fenced or indented code remain source
text. Other thinking text remains plain pre-wrapped text.

Provider formats observed so far:

| Provider | Thinking content shape | Markdown-like conventions |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Codex | `thinking` content blocks, including reasoning summaries | Often emits standalone `**section**` lines, blank-line-separated prose, and occasional backtick/fenced-code snippets. |
| Claude | Native `thinking` blocks when enabled | Usually plain prose; detailed Markdown conventions not yet catalogued. |
| Grok | ACP `agent_thought_chunk` normalized to YA `thinking` | Structured plan/thought data exists in provider docs; final visible formatting still incomplete. |
| OpenCode | ACP `reasoning` normalized to YA `thinking` for live events | Durable reload handling is incomplete; formatting conventions not yet catalogued. |

## Always-on transforms

These run unconditionally and are not user-configurable:

- **ANSI escape stripping** — applied before all rendering so raw escape codes
  never appear as literal characters. (`stripAnsiEscapes` inside `renderFixedFontRichContent`)
- **Shiki syntax highlighting** — server-side, keyed on file extension, stored as
  `_highlightedContentHtml` on `ReadResultWithAugment`. Applied only to files the
  server recognises as source code.
- **Server markdown rendering** — server-side, for `.md`/`.markdown` files, stored
  as `_renderedMarkdownHtml`. Produces sanitised HTML used for the default preview.
- **Explicit rendered Markdown file links** — project file links open the
  standalone file viewer on browser link gestures, and `.md` / `.markdown`
  local-file links can request a content-only rendered document. That document
  includes a raw link and expands local image links directly. Public-share file
  previews hydrate those local image references through embedded bounded media
  blobs when present, falling back to the share-scoped relay route rather than
  navigating to authenticated local file APIs.
- **Assistant inline-code project file links** — when authenticated session
  Markdown renders with project context, inline-code filename references such
  as `` `topics/security.md` `` link to the project file viewer only if the
  target currently exists under the project root. The Markdown parser's
  existing `codespan` token is the detection boundary; YA does not reparse raw
  assistant Markdown for this.
- **Line numbers** — shown in the plain-text fallback path (no Shiki highlight).

## File Content Viewer Contract

When a renderer shows file contents outside an inline transcript block, it
should use the shared `FileViewer` surface with a `FileViewerSource` adapter
rather than a bespoke modal. The common primitive is a full-file view with an
optional source span (`line` / `lineEnd`) and an optional compact range-only
mode. Read links, Edit filename links, standalone file pages, and public-share
file links should therefore inherit the same source/preview controls,
large-file windowing, hline span markers, scrollbars, copy affordance, media
hydration, and public-share capability scoping.

## Toggleable transforms (sigma Σ button)

`FixedFontMathToggle` wraps a source view and, if `rendered.changed = true`, shows
a small circular Σ button at the bottom-right of the panel. Clicking it toggles
between source and rendered mode; state is per-panel (local override) or globally
toggled via Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+M.

**What the toggle renders:**

- Markdown tables (`| col | col |` syntax) → `<table>` with aligned cells
- Markdown headings, blockquotes, lists, horizontal rules → styled inline elements
- Inline math `$…$` and display math `$$…$$` → KaTeX HTML
- Backtick inline code → `<code>` spans
- Bold `**…**` / `__…__` → `<strong>`
- Markdown file links `[label](./path)` → clickable links that open a file-viewer
- Unified diffs — detected automatically via `looksLikeUnifiedDiff`; diff-aware
  mode strips `+`/`-` gutter before rendering inline content and colours lines

**Detection heuristic (`mayHaveFixedFontRichContent`):** returns true if the
source text contains `$`, `` ` ``, `[`, `**`, or `__`, or if any line matches a
markdown structural pattern. This is deliberately broad to avoid missed renders on
output that mixes prose and code; see "code file exclusion" below.

**Global render mode:** `RenderModeProvider` holds `globalMode` (default
`"rendered"`) and a set of per-panel override IDs. A panel starts in the global
mode unless the user has toggled it locally. `toggleGlobalMode` resets all local
overrides. Assistant turn prose has its own local source/render toggle and does
not participate in this global mode; the bottom-bar render-mode control is scoped
to `FixedFontMathToggle` panels.

## Code file exclusion — and math opt-in

Source files identified by Shiki (`_highlightedContentHtml` present) skip the
full `FixedFontMathToggle` pipeline in `FileModalContent`. Rationale: TypeScript,
JavaScript, Python etc. are saturated with `$` (template literals), `` ` ``,
`[` (arrays), `**` (operators), and `//` (comments that trigger heading heuristics),
causing near-universal false-positive detection of markdown structure. Shiki already
provides the best available source view.

**Math opt-in for code files:** `FileModalContent` runs `renderFixedFontMath`
(KaTeX only — no markdown structural transforms) on the raw content. If real math
is detected (`rendered.changed = true`), a Σ button appears defaulting to **off**.
Clicking it switches from the Shiki-highlighted view to a plain-text+KaTeX view;
clicking again restores Shiki. This uses a local `useState(false)` rather than
the global render mode, so the default stays off regardless of Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+M.
Note: math mode currently loses Shiki colouring — the two renders are mutually
exclusive until a compositing path is built.

Filename-affiliated plain-text files retain only the math portion of the
`FixedFontMathToggle` pipeline unless their extension is Markdown-like (`.md`,
`.markdown`, `.mdx`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdn`). This avoids structural Markdown
false positives from source files without Shiki highlighting, especially TSX
template literals and backtick-heavy code.

For markdown files, `FileModalContent` uses its own outer Σ button (not
`FixedFontMathToggle`) to toggle between the server-rendered HTML preview and
the raw source view — avoiding double-sigma situations.

Edit diffs and raw patches follow the same filename gate. A diff is rich-rendered
only when its target path set is entirely Markdown-like; otherwise it is math-only
even if the diff contains backticks, tables, or bold markers. Bash/command output
is not filename-affiliated and still uses the broad organic rich-content
heuristic, because command output often mixes prose, diffs, tables, and math with
no reliable file extension.

## Summary affordances

Long one-line summaries keep the row tail visible by reserving result/count
columns and applying normal end-ellipsis only to the variable expression. Grep
uses the left timeline dot as its outline affordance: clicking the dot expands
the full search expression under the clipped header while keeping the match count
visible. The clipped pattern text is also clickable as a secondary target, but the
dot is the stable control.

Bash/Ran rows keep the left dot and row middle for the existing output-preview
show/hide behavior. The command text itself is a separate click target; clicking
it expands the full command inline with wrapping, so a huge command can be
inspected without collapsing the output preview accidentally.

## Sigma button placement and scroll preservation

The Σ button is `position: absolute; right: 0.4rem; bottom: 0.25rem` within its
`.fixed-font-render-toggle` container — intentionally inside the container's
right edge to avoid overlap with the `UserTurnNavigator` scrollbar rail (which
occupies the rightmost ~34px of the viewport at z-index 25).

When the toggle changes the panel's height, `useScrollPreservingToggle`
(`lib/scrollAnchor.ts`) records the button's offset from the nearest
`overflow: auto/scroll` ancestor before calling the toggle, then restores
`scrollTop` via `useLayoutEffect` (before paint) so the button appears
stationary.

## Why source code read/edit sections are not rich-rendered

Even when a source file contains legitimate markdown or KaTeX in doc-comments or
string literals, applying `FixedFontMathToggle` to the whole file would be
incorrect: the renderer has no syntactic knowledge of the host language and cannot
distinguish a `$` that begins inline math from one that is part of a shell
variable, a PHP sigil, a JavaScript template literal, or a regex. Similarly,
`#` in Python/shell is a comment character but triggers heading detection; `---`
in a YAML front-matter separator triggers horizontal-rule detection inside
surrounding code.

The KaTeX inline-math filter (`tryMatchInlineMath`) is deliberately tight: it
requires at least one of `\ ^ { } +` or a digit inside the `$…$` span, and
rejects patterns that look like shell variable spans (`$VAR >>$OTHER`). In
practice this filters out the vast majority of false positives in prose and
command output. Edge cases remain — e.g. `echo $A=+$B` in a Bash snippet,
where `$A=+$B` satisfies the `+` heuristic — so the filter is good but not
exact.

For rich-rendering inside source code to make sense, the renderer would need to:

1. Parse the host language well enough to identify comment and string-literal
   token boundaries (or receive those boundaries pre-computed from the server
   alongside the Shiki highlight data).
2. Apply inline math rendering only within those token spans, not to the
   whole file (markdown structural transforms like headings and lists would
   still be suppressed).
3. Composite the Shiki-coloured source tokens with the rendered inline content
   so neither layer clobbers the other.

This is a non-trivial language-aware post-processing step. The ambition of
showing LaTeX math inside source-code reads/edits — scoped to doc-comments and
string literals — may be revisited in the future. Until then, the safe choice
is to show Shiki-highlighted source as-is and let the user read embedded
formulas as literal text, matching the experience in their editor.

## Known gaps / future work

- Local resource links need a shared context-aware routing layer so rendered
  `/api/local-file`, `/api/local-image`, and project-file links do not bypass
  the secure relay path in hosted remote mode. See
  [`docs/tactical/009-local-resource-link-routing.md`](../docs/tactical/009-local-resource-link-routing.md).
- C/C++ UTF-8 escape sequences in string literals (e.g. `"\xc3\xa9"` → `é`) are
  not decoded. This would require detecting string literal boundaries and only
  applying UTF-8 decoding there, with the same Σ toggle UI.
- Comment/string-literal markdown rendering in source files is not attempted;
  the tradeoff between false positives and useful rendering favours
  source-only display for all code.
- GitHub-flavored Markdown footnotes (`[^id]` / `[^id]: ...`) are not yet
  supported by the server Markdown renderer. If footnote support is added later,
  full-file previews should render real footnotes, and a whole-document preview
  that marks a selected range should keep those document-level footnotes
  semantically intact. Exact range-only previews may use a lower-cost local
  treatment instead of reproducing table-footnote layout: when the displayed
  range references a footnote, pull in only that matching definition and show it
  inline, as a tooltip, or as a compact note after the rendered fragment. A
  future higher-fidelity range marker path should render the document in whole
  chunks with renderer-provided or coarse source-line alignment, then place range
  markers against that rendered output.
- Edit diff rich render does not yet inline-expand image links. This would help
  Markdown edits that add or update `![image](...)`, but it should share the
  local-media hydration path rather than adding a second image loader.
