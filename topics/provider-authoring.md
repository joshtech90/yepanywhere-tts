# Provider Authoring (new-provider-for-harness)

## Documentation sufficiency (honest assessment, 2026-07-01)

Adding a provider today is a **read-the-source-plus-snoop-JSONL** exercise, not
a spec-driven one. What exists:

- **Source of truth for normalized objects is code, not prose.** The message /
  content / tool-result shapes YA renders are the Zod schemas in
  `packages/shared/src/claude-sdk-schema/` (`message/`, `content/`, `tool/`,
  `entry/`, `guards.ts`). These are authoritative and validated against real
  sessions; there is no separate hand-written object-format doc that could drift
  from them.
- **Per-provider JSONL/quirk knowledge is scattered** across per-provider
  topics (`codex-sessions`, `codex-metadata-scanner`, `pi-provider`, `grok`,
  `opencode-backend`, …), inline code comments, and the reader/normalizer
  modules — not centralized. `docs/project/multi-provider-integration.md` is the
  best single architectural overview but is a comparison/overview, not a
  step-by-step authoring guide.
- **The interface contract is discoverable but implicit.** `AgentProvider`
  (`packages/server/src/sdk/providers/types.ts`) is the surface; the fastest
  authoring path is to copy the closest existing provider and diff.

This topic is the intended entry point that ties those together. It is a
pointer-hub by design (per the request "even if it's just a pointer"); deepen it
as real authoring friction is found, rather than duplicating the schemas.

## The two halves a provider must implement

1. **Live session** (running turns): implement `AgentProvider`
   (`sdk/providers/types.ts:191`) — install/auth checks, `startSession`
   yielding an `AsyncIterableIterator` of messages, a send `queue`, and `abort`.
   Existing impls: `sdk/providers/{claude,codex,codex-oss,gemini,gemini-acp,opencode,grok-acp,pi}.ts`.
2. **Persisted reader** (reload from disk): a `sessions/<provider>-reader.ts`
   that reads the provider's stored format and produces the same normalized
   `Message` objects the live path yields. Existing: `codex-reader.ts`,
   `pi-reader.ts`, `grok-reader.ts`, plus the shared `reader.ts` /
   `null-reader.ts`.

Both halves converge on the shared `Message`/render-item model via
normalization (`sessions/normalization.ts` dispatch; provider-specific
normalizers like `codex/normalization.ts`). A new provider's normalized output
must validate against the `claude-sdk-schema` Zod types.

## The convergence contract: paired stream items settle to persisted shape

The live and reader halves are two producers of the *same* session, so they
must strongly converge for items present in both — see
[stream-persisted-render-parity](stream-persisted-render-parity.md). Concretely,
structured facts that define a durable tool call's identity, ordering,
grouping, parameters, result, or settled layout must be recoverable into the
same fields on reload. Useful live-only tail events may render transiently;
they are tested as a lifecycle rather than forced into provider persistence.
Add a stream+persisted fixture to `test/render-parity.test.ts` for paired tool
items; a green unit test on one path is not proof the settled render converges.

## Snooping real session JSONL

- **Validate a provider's persisted sessions** against the schemas:
  `npx tsx scripts/validate-jsonl.ts [path]` (see root `CLAUDE.md`
  § Validating Session Data). This is the fastest way to learn a format's real
  shape and catch schema gaps.
- **Capture live SDK objects**: run with `LOG_SDK_MESSAGES=true` →
  `~/.yep-anywhere/logs/sdk-raw.jsonl`, then
  `npx tsx scripts/validate-tool-results.ts` to check `tool_use_result` shapes.
- **Storage locations** per provider are tabulated in
  `docs/project/multi-provider-integration.md` (e.g. Codex `~/.codex/sessions/`,
  OpenCode SQLite under `~/.local/share/opencode/`).

## Gaps worth closing (if authoring friction recurs)

- A short "minimum viable provider" checklist (interface methods, reader,
  normalizer, parity fixture, session-tree/liveness hooks) would turn this hub
  into a guide.
- Per-provider "JSONL object shapes" are only in code/schemas; a generated
  schema reference (from the Zod types) would document the normalized objects
  without a drift risk.
