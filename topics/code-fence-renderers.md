# Code-Fence Language Renderers

Status: implemented. `normalizeCodeBlockLanguage` and the `language-*` marker
run server-side; `useCodeFenceRenderers` labels blocks and dispatches renderers
client-side; `mermaidRenderer` is the one registered renderer. The pre-existing
`ansi` and `toon` cases still live inside `renderCodeWithHighlighter` as
server-side branches rather than registry members.

See also [`rich-text-rendering.md`](rich-text-rendering.md) for the surrounding
render pipeline and [`active-content-security.md`](active-content-security.md)
for which trust class a renderer's output falls into.

## The info string is one language name

In CommonMark everything after the opening fence is an *info string*. Only its
first word is conventionally a language; the rest is renderer-specific
attributes. YA reduces it to a single comparable token: trim, take the first
whitespace-delimited word, lowercase. Anything left is discarded.

`normalizeCodeBlockLanguage` in
`packages/server/src/augments/code-language.ts` is the one implementation.

This applies to **every** code-block language string, not only ones some
renderer claims. `BlockDetector` normalizes at fence detection, for both the
completed-block and streaming-block paths, and both `AugmentGenerator` entry
points normalize before rendering. So the Shiki grammar lookup, the `ansi` and
`toon` special cases, the loaded-language set, and the emitted class all see
the same form, and a fence written ```` ```JavaScript ```` behaves like
```` ```javascript ````.

The fence-detection regexes previously required `(\w*)`, which rejected an info
string containing a space or a punctuation attribute outright — such a line was
not recognized as a fence at all and fell through to paragraph handling. They
now accept `(.*)` and let normalization drop the tail.

## Every rendered block carries its language

A per-language client renderer needs the language in the DOM. The plain
fallback (`renderPlainCodeBlock`) and the ANSI path already emitted
`class="language-<name>"`, but Shiki did not: its output encodes the language
only in token colors, so a highlighted block was indistinguishable from any
other. A Shiki `code` transformer now adds the same class.

That one class is the whole client-facing contract. The client reads the
language from `pre > code[class*="language-"]` and never re-derives it from the
original fence text. The shared sanitizer already allows `class` on `code`, so
this needs no allowlist change.

Not covered: the rendered-Markdown-file path in `renderSafeMarkdown` uses
markdown-it's default fence rule, which emits `language-<first word of info>`
with the original case preserved. Bringing that path onto the same
normalization is unresolved.

`useCodeFenceRenderers` lowercases the name it reads out of the class, so
renderer dispatch and the language label already agree across both paths. That
is a client-side tolerance for the gap above, not a substitute for closing it:
the emitted class itself still differs between the two paths, so anything that
matches on the class text rather than reading it is still exposed.

## The default language affordance

A marked code block names its language on hover and on tap. It adds no visible
chrome, no badge in the resting state, and no layout change: the existing
default is not buggy, so the label stays a non-disturbing addition. A block
with no language, or one whose info string normalizes away, shows nothing.

Three details are load-bearing:

- The label is a CSS pseudo-element fed by the block's own data attribute, so
  it can never enter a text selection or a copied code block. A real element
  inside the `<pre>` would.
- Pointer devices reveal it on hover; keyboards reveal it on focus, which the
  highlighter's `tabindex` already provides. A tap sets a data attribute that
  clears itself, so touch reaches the same label without turning it into
  permanent chrome.
- The block carries an `aria-label` but deliberately no `title`. A native
  tooltip on every code block would fire while reading or selecting code, a
  second behind the label and saying the same word.

## The renderer registry

Dispatch is a lookup in a map keyed by normalized language name. Two properties
matter more than the shape of the map:

- **Registration happens once.** Explicit registration at module load is the
  preferred form because it is the simplest thing that works and it keeps the
  set of renderers greppable. Scanning a directory once at startup to
  auto-register is also acceptable.
- **A code block never scans.** Rendering a block must cost a map lookup.
  No filesystem probe, no asset discovery, no dynamic resolution per block.
  Whatever a renderer needs, it acquires at registration or on its own first
  use, not per occurrence.

`registry.ts` holds the map, `renderers.ts` holds the one call per member, and
`mermaidRenderer.ts` holds the only member today. A renderer takes the source
text and either returns markup or declines. Declining leaves the highlighted
source in place, so an unparseable diagram is still readable.

`ansi` and `toon` remain language-keyed branches inside
`renderCodeWithHighlighter` rather than registry members. They belong here
eventually — the registry is where language-keyed rendering should live — but
they run server-side and produce HTML for the augment stream, so folding them
in means the registry has to span both halves. That is a separate change.

## Mermaid

Mermaid is the motivating case and the reason the registry has a client half:
it lays diagrams out against a live DOM, so it cannot run in the server augment
generator. The split is therefore:

- The server emits nothing special. A ```` ```mermaid ```` fence produces the
  ordinary marked code block. No new server dependency, no sanitizer
  relaxation, and a client that does not implement the renderer still shows
  readable diagram source.
- `useCodeFenceRenderers` finds `pre > code.language-mermaid` inside an
  already-rendered container and wraps the block so the diagram and its source
  can each be the visible view. Mermaid itself is a dynamic import, so a
  session with no diagrams never downloads it.
- On a parse or render failure the code block is left exactly as it was.

Two consequences of the dynamic import are worth knowing before touching the
build. Mermaid's core chunk and its per-diagram-type chunks each sit near
700 kB, which is above Vite's default 500 kB warning and therefore above YA's
warning-free build policy. Both client configs raise
`chunkSizeWarningLimit` to 750 kB on the grounds that these chunks arrive only
when a transcript contains a diagram and never enter the initial load. The
ceiling still has to catch an *entry* chunk reaching that size, which is what
the policy was protecting.

The render cache is keyed on renderer, source text, and resolved light/dark
appearance. Keying on appearance is what makes a theme switch redraw a diagram
with the new palette instead of reusing stale SVG; the hook watches
`data-theme` and the system color-scheme query to trigger that pass. Entries
hold rendered SVG, so the cache is bounded and evicts the oldest rather than
growing for the life of the tab.

### Inline SVG from a reviewed renderer is allowed

Mermaid's SVG is displayed inline as ordinary reviewed-renderer output. No new
allowlist, no rasterization, no sandbox. Mermaid is a reviewed renderer, and
its own `securityLevel: "strict"` stays on because it costs nothing.

The untrusted-active-document rule that SVG follows the active-document policy
even when the UI calls it an image governs SVG *bytes* YA received and cannot
reason about — a project file, an upload, a share. It does not govern markup a
renderer YA chose and ships produced from text. KaTeX is the standing example
of the latter: `renderSafeMarkdown` buffers its `span`/`svg` output past the
sanitizer rather than growing the allowlist to cover it. Trust rests on
renderer selection and upkeep, so an advisory against such a renderer is an
upgrade-or-drop decision rather than a reason to add a second sanitizer.

YA has no SVG sanitization path for the case where the renderer is *not*
reviewed, and nothing mechanically distinguishes the two classes. That is
captured in
[`gaps/svg-sanitization-for-unreviewed-renderers.md`](../gaps/svg-sanitization-for-unreviewed-renderers.md)
and does not affect Mermaid.

### Control is the source/render toggle

The user-facing control for a rendered diagram is the ordinary source-or-
rendered choice YA already offers everywhere else, not a security setting. A
Mermaid block renders as a diagram by default and toggles back to its
highlighted source on demand, reusing the Σ affordance and hover behavior of
the fixed-font panels rather than introducing a per-language control.
Rendering by default is the deliberate choice here: showing diagram source
where a diagram was requested is the defect this feature exists to fix, so it
is not a case of disturbing a sound default.

The toggle's accessible name says which thing it switches — "Show diagram
source", not "Show source". An assistant message carries its own
source/rendered toggle, so the bare label leaves two same-named buttons in one
message. Any renderer added later needs a distinguishing noun for the same
reason.

Where a hover pointer does not exist, the toggle is always visible instead of
fading in, because it is then the only way back to source.

## Streaming

A client may re-render on each streaming augment, but that is not the usual
case and no renderer should be designed around it. Streaming code blocks
deliberately take the plain fallback path with no highlighting, so a partial
Mermaid source would simply fail to parse.

Two consequences for the renderer contract: an incomplete source is "not yet",
never an error, and a renderer must not do expensive work per token. The
natural point to attempt a render is the completed-block augment; a client that
does attempt earlier should gate retries on the source actually having changed.

`useCodeFenceRenderers` implements that with one attempt per exact source text,
recorded on the block. A growing source produces a new key and is retried; a
source that declined is not retried in a loop. Mutation bursts coalesce to one
pass per animation frame, so per-token cost is a scan rather than a render.
