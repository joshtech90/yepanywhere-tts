# Restart / Handoff Template

Topic: restart-handoff-template

The text a fresh session receives as its first user message when a running
session is restarted or handed off. Built server-side by
`buildRestartHandoff` / `buildRestartTranscript` in
`packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts`, seeded via `startSession` from the
`POST /projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId/restart` route (handoff mode).

Distinct from two neighbours:
- **fork** mode copies the real provider transcript into a new session; it does
  not use this template.
- [`forged-transcript-handoff`](forged-transcript-handoff.md) is a proposed
  *replacement* for this template (write a filtered provider-format transcript
  and resume it). This doc governs the template that ships today.

Related: [`compact-and-handoff`](compact-and-handoff.md),
[`session-context-actions`](session-context-actions.md),
[`session-reactivation`](session-reactivation.md).

## Why lean matters here

At handoff time the user often **cannot compact** (over provider quota), so no
`## Provider-Native Compact Summary` is present and this template is the *sole*
recovery payload. Every token spent on framing noise is a token unavailable to
real recent turns. The template therefore optimizes for signal density, and
leans on a pointer back to the source session for any detail it drops.

## Slimming contract (implemented)

The activity/transcript projection keeps only what a successor can act on
without the (dropped) tool output:

**Kept**
- Recent **user turns** — verbatim, the load-bearing directions. A light
  `### user` divider separates them; timestamps removed.
- Real **assistant prose** (conclusions/explanations the agent wrote).
- **Shell commands** (`Bash`/`shell` tools) rendered bare as `$ <command>` —
  the one tool class whose intent reads without its output.

**Dropped entirely**
- All timestamps (were on every turn/tool line).
- **Non-shell tool_use** lines (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `WriteStdin`, …) — the
  call detail is in the source jsonl, not here.
- All **tool_result** lines (the `output omitted (N chars)` placeholders).
- All **thinking** blocks/placeholders.
- Per-item `### role`/timestamp headers in the **activity** section — assistant
  prose and `$ commands` are self-delimiting under the section header.

Rationale for aggression: detail is recoverable from the source jsonl (see
*Provider hint* below), so the handoff need not carry it.

Code: `summarizeToolUse` (shell-only), `renderRestartActivityContent`
(results/thinking → `""`), `formatRestartMessage` (bare activity, `### user`
divider), `shellCommandFromInput`. Size budgets remain the `RESTART_HANDOFF_*`
constants (40k total); slimming frees room within the same caps.

## Source Session block (implemented)

```
## Source Session

- Session ID: <id>
- URL: <the client URL the user was on>    (omitted if absent/invalid)
- Project path: <path>
- Provider: <provider>
- Model: <model>
- Full transcript on <YA hostname> (read or grep there …): <path>
  (omitted if unknown)
```

- **URL replaces the internal process id.** The client passes
  `window.location.href` as `sourceUrl` in the restart body
  (`RestartSessionModal` → `api.restartSession`); the server validates it to a
  single `http(s)` token (`formatRestartSourceUrl`) and renders it verbatim. It
  is self-documenting and clickable/resumable, unlike `Previous YA process:
  <uuid>`.
- **Transcript pointer** (see below) identifies both the YA host and the
  host-local path. When the successor uses an SSH executor, the line also
  names that executor so the host boundary is explicit.
- **Dropped:** the `- Provider-native compact: …` status line (the compaction
  *attempt* still runs for its boundary effect — `tryRestartCompact` — its
  status is just no longer echoed) and the `- Restart reason:` line (always
  "Manual restart from Yep Anywhere" — no signal).

## Provider transcript pointer (implemented)

The provider's **reader** — not the runtime `AgentProvider` — owns transcript
storage, so the pointer comes from `ISessionReader.getSessionFilePath(sessionId)`
(`packages/server/src/sessions/types.ts`), the same optional method already used
for cloning. It returns the source session's on-disk `.jsonl` (or `null`).
Layouts differ per provider, which is why it's reader-owned:
- Claude: `<sessionDir>/<sessionId>.jsonl` (added to `ClaudeSessionReader` in
  `reader.ts` — the one reader that lacked it; probes every `allSessionDirs`
  candidate and stats for existence).
- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` (scan by id).
- Pi: `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<cwd>--/<ISO-ts>_<uuid>.jsonl` (scan by id).
- opencode: DB-backed → returns `null` → no line.

Wiring: the restart route resolves the source reader via `resolveSessionReader`
(the renamed general resolver, formerly `…ForAgentContent`), calls
`getSessionFilePath(sessionId)`, and threads the result to `buildRestartHandoff`
as `sourceTranscriptPath` (rendered by `formatRestartTranscriptPath`).

The pointer references the **source** session and is a plain file on the YA
server host, so switching providers does not change which reader resolves it.
The line names `os.hostname()` and, when present, the successor's executor.
Absent/`null` → no line.

Remote-executor seam: a successor running over SSH may not be able to open the
YA host's absolute path, and the remote Claude transcript sync completes in the
background after provider results. The qualified pointer is therefore useful
provenance, not a promise that every successor can read a current file. A
future executor-aware handoff artifact should either transfer/translate and
confirm the path or retain omitted activity when it cannot establish that
guarantee.

## User-highlight marking (proposed, postponed)

**Not scheduled.** Design as agreed:

- **Motivation.** When handing off, the user highlights the region they care
  about. Since the handoff carries only the last-N turns and the highlight is
  almost always within that already-included region, no separate composer field
  is needed (an earlier "editable prefilled field" idea is superseded) — mark it
  **in place**.
- **Marking.** Wrap the highlighted span in regular XML-ish tags, e.g.
  `<user-highlight>…</user-highlight>`. Highlights can be intraline, so the
  tags are ordinary inline markers (split lines or inline as needed), not
  line-oriented open/close delimiters.
- **Granularity: message-range.** The browser selection is over the *rich* chat
  UI, but the handoff is a *summarized* projection, so an exact character span
  won't reliably appear verbatim. Identify which messages the selection
  intersects (via DOM message ids), include them, and wrap that message range.
  Optional substring-narrowing only when the selected text still appears in the
  rendered message; never rely on it.
- **Window extension.** If the highlighted region starts before the normal
  last-N cutoff, extend the included range backward so the whole highlight is
  present (bounded by `RESTART_HANDOFF_MAX_CHARS`).
- **Transport.** Client passes the selected message-id range (and optionally the
  selected text) in the restart body, alongside the existing `sourceUrl`.

## Tests

`packages/server/test/routes/sessions-metadata.test.ts` — "summarizes fallback
activity and appends queued turns last" asserts the slim format (URL line,
transcript-pointer line, `$` bash command kept, prose kept; timestamps /
non-bash tool_use / tool_result / thinking dropped) and is the guard for this
contract.

`packages/server/test/session-sandbox.test.ts` — "reconstructs a private
transcript reader after metadata reload" covers `ClaudeSessionReader
.getSessionFilePath` (found in an additional dir; `null` for a missing id).
