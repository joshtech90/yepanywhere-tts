# Attachment Storage

Topic: attachment-storage

Parent contract: [Project Directory Storage](project-directory-storage.md).

Settings surface: [Storage Settings](storage-settings.md).

Status: corrected in current source after `0.7.0`; no stable npm release
contains the storage-location setting yet. The release history below explains
the missing-capability warning for older servers.

## Why Attachments Are Stored

An uploaded file must survive long enough for the provider to read it, for a
queued message to deliver it, and for the transcript to display or download it.
That is intentional attachment persistence initiated by the upload action. It
does not imply consent to place the bytes inside the selected project.

Two locations have existed:

- **YA data directory:**
  `<data-dir>/uploads/<base64url(project)>/<session>/`. This was the original
  implementation. It is centrally confined and project-namespaced.
- **Project directory:** `<project>/.attachments/<session>/`. This became the
  runtime default in commit `46bb9929` and first shipped in npm `0.5.0`.

Project-local storage made an attachment easy for a provider running in the
working tree to discover. That convenience is real, especially under a
provider sandbox, but it does not justify an ambient project write. A Git
exclude only hides the symptom from `git status`; it does not address checkout
growth, synchronization, backups, privacy, or ownership of the project
namespace.

Candidate private-input behavior is recorded separately in the
[agent command runtime sketch](agent-command-runtime.sketches.md); it is not a
current attachment-storage contract.

## Release History And Pre-Correction Behavior

Before this correction there was no implemented attachment storage setting.
The earlier "Configuration — v1" prose in this topic described a design that
never landed.

Stable npm releases `0.5.0`, `0.5.1`, `0.5.2`, `0.6.0`, `0.6.1`, `0.6.2`, and
`0.7.0` route uploads to `<project>/.attachments/<session>/` whenever the upload
route resolves a project path. They retain the older data-directory location
as a read fallback.

Those stable releases predate the shared managed-directory helper and do not
themselves guarantee a `.git/info/exclude` entry. Source between the `0.7.0`
tag and this correction called `ensureManagedProjectDir`, which could create
the top-level directory and append `.attachments/` to the clone-local exclude
file automatically.

Pre-session staging was already central and temporary. Before this correction,
materializing a staged file into a real session moved it into the same
project-local final location, so staging did not avoid the policy issue.

## Location Resolution

The first implementation uses the one global
`projectDirectoryStorage: "app-data" | "project"` setting from the parent
contract. There is no per-project override.

### App data only — default

Final attachments are written below:

```text
<data-dir>/projects/<project-key>/attachments/<session-id>/
```

Uploading and sending an attachment must not create `.attachments`, `.yep`, or
a Git exclusion. The provider prompt names the actual attachment path. If a
provider's filesystem policy cannot read the central path, YA explains that
limitation or requires the user to opt into project-local storage; it does not
change modes silently.

### Store YA assets with projects — explicit opt-in

Attachments may be written below the one documented YA project root. The
preferred new-write shape is:

```text
<project>/.yep/attachments/<session-id>/
```

This avoids creating another top-level hidden namespace. The implementation
may retain `.attachments/` as a compatibility read location, but must not keep
using it as an independent automatic write root merely because older versions
did.

Before the first project-local write, validate containment, reject symlinked or
already tracked managed roots, and apply the parent topic's opt-in Git-exclude
policy. A failure does not fall back by writing somewhere else inside the
project.

## Agent Delivery Contract

The delivered message includes an explicit path and small safe metadata such
as filename, MIME type, size, and image dimensions. The surrounding label must
not hard-code "files in `.attachments`" when the actual location is central or
under `.yep/attachments`.

Attachments remain provider input. They are distinct from tool-result media,
which is viewer output and is never appended automatically to a later turn.
See [Session Media Handles](session-media-handles.md).

## Read And Serve Compatibility

The narrow attachment route remains the browser-facing read boundary:

```text
GET /api/projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId/upload/:filename
```

It may check, in policy-defined order:

1. the current central app-data location;
2. the opted-in current project-local location; and
3. legacy `<project>/.attachments/<session>/` and legacy central paths.

A file is materialized under the session id known at upload time, which
can differ from the logical session the client is viewing. Confirmed
sources of divergence: the YA-generated provisional startup id used for a
brand-new session's first turn (the provider reports the canonical id
only after launch — see [Session ID Remap Events](session-id-remap.md)),
and an explicit session fork, whose new id inherits turns whose
attachments live under the source id. A current-version plain resume does
not rotate the id (verified 2026-08-07 against live session files:
entries carry only the filename's own `sessionId` across many resumed
turns).

Files are never moved to follow an id change: the delivered prompt names
the physical path, and a provider may re-read it at any later turn. The
persisted turn therefore also tells the browser where the file lives, and
the client derives the URL's `<session>` segment from the physical
directory in the persisted path — never from the viewed logical session
id. Persisted paths from both Windows and POSIX hosts retain this routing
identity; client parsing accepts either platform's directory separator. Only
the `<project>` segment uses logical identity, because an
app-data project key is not reversible to a URL project id. The route
performs exact lookups only; it does not search sibling session
directories.

Reading a legacy attachment never authorizes creating, refreshing, migrating,
or excluding that directory. The public response does not expose a new broad
filesystem read capability merely because physical storage moved.

Authenticated file viewers treat
`<data-dir>/projects/<project-key>/attachments/` as always readable, even
when the uploads file-access toggle is off. That path is YA-managed
attachment storage, not an arbitrary extra folder. A `Read` of an
attachment therefore opens in the same file viewer as a project file
instead of returning `400 Invalid file path`.

Public shares, frozen or live, may open the same attachment only when that
exact path appears in the share body. The viewer uses the existing
share-scoped file route and bearer secret; the client keeps
attachment-shaped `~/` or absolute paths as the share `path` instead of
dropping them as outside-project. The share still does not grant
`/etc/passwd` or other app-data files just because they were mentioned.

## Retention And Cleanup

Attachment retention and cleanup remain incomplete. Central storage makes a
bounded age/size policy and global cleanup practical; project-local opt-in
requires equally explicit per-project reporting and cleanup.

Changing storage mode does not move or delete existing attachments. A future
cleanup/migration action must show exact paths, sizes, and consequences before
mutation. Legacy reads remain until a separately approved compatibility
decision removes them.

## Capability Gate

The location control is part of the permanent
`project-directory-storage-policy` capability. Without it, a new client sends
no storage field and warns that the older server may write uploads into project
directories. See the parent topic for the full release corpus and absent-gate
behavior.
