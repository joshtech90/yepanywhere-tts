## Observable contract

- A usage read never creates a provider turn or persisted provider session.
  Claude uses the Agent SDK's read-only control query; Codex uses app-server
  `account/rateLimits/read`. YA does not scrape provider web pages, invoke a
  slash command, or infer account capacity from local transcript token totals.
- The server returns `ProviderSubscriptionUsage | null`. Each normalized window
  carries percent used, optional duration/reset time, and either provider-wide
  scope or an explicit set of YA model ids. Provider-specific response fields
  do not cross the server provider boundary.
- A model's compact value is the maximum percent used among every applicable
  provider-wide and model-scoped window. This is the binding quota: highest
  utilization, equivalently the smallest remaining capacity. The detail view
  shows every applicable window.
- Unknown model-specific buckets are omitted rather than applied to every
  model. Accounts or auth modes without subscription quotas, unsupported
  providers, and failed upstream reads return null and add no usage UI.
- Usage is demand-fetched, cached briefly per source and provider on both sides
  of the client/server boundary, and explicitly refreshable from the detail
  view.
- Direct-demand surfaces acquire usage immediately. New Session classifies only
  its first acquisition as supplementary startup work, after earlier route
  tiers such as selected-provider readiness. Explicit Refresh bypasses that
  startup gate, including while the initial acquisition is still waiting; the
  shared cache prevents a later duplicate when Refresh already supplied the
  value.

## Codex local account commands

Codex `/status` and `/usage` are local account commands, not model prompts.
YA advertises and intercepts them only for active Codex sessions:

- `/status` combines the resolved session model, working directory,
  permission mode, provider thread id, latest cumulative session-token
  snapshot, `account/read`, and `account/rateLimits/read`. A failed account or
  rate-limit probe leaves the local session fields available and marks only
  that section unavailable.
- `/usage [daily|weekly|cumulative]` reads `account/usage/read`. Empty, `day`,
  and `daily` arguments select the daily view; `week` and `weekly` select the
  weekly view. Invalid arguments report the accepted forms. Unlike the Codex
  TUI's interactive no-argument picker, YA's non-interactive `/usage` defaults
  to daily. YA exposes only this read-only branch; it does not consume account
  rate-limit reset credits.
- Account token activity from `/usage` is historical activity, not remaining
  subscription capacity. Rate-limit windows remain the source of subscription
  capacity, while per-session token notifications remain the source of context
  consumption.
- `account/usage/read` requires ChatGPT-backed Codex authentication. API-key,
  signed-out, and Amazon Bedrock accounts receive `Sign in with ChatGPT to use
  /usage.` and do not make the usage request.

Neither command creates a model turn or provider transcript entry. YA emits the
result as a synthetic `local_command` row into the active session's live and
short replay streams; it does not claim provider persistence for that row.

## Client surfaces

The compact binding percentage appears beside model choices in New Session,
Model Settings, live Model Switch, and Handoff Session. The session context
indicator has two distinct interactions:

- left click, Enter, or Space opens all applicable subscription windows and
  reset times when usage is available;
- right click or touch long-press opens the existing per-model compact-threshold
  editor. The usage detail also links to that editor so it remains keyboard
  accessible.

The context trigger and either dialog are separate interactive surfaces.
Keyboard or pointer activation of Refresh, Edit, or another dialog control
acts on that control without retriggering the context indicator.

The existing context percentage remains context-window consumption, not
subscription usage.

## Compatibility

`provider-subscription-usage` is a transitional server capability covering
`GET /api/providers/:name/subscription-usage`. A client must observe the
capability before making the request. Without it, the client makes no
unsupported request, shows no subscription-usage badges or detail, and
preserves the passive context tooltip plus compact-threshold interaction.

The implementation was reviewed against stable releases `v0.7.0` and
`v0.6.2`, neither of which has the capability or route. This narrow optional
feature does not raise `remoteCompatibilityLevel`.

## Provider boundaries

Claude Agent SDK `0.3.220` marks its subscription-usage control method
experimental. `ClaudeProvider` contains that instability: the normalizer
accepts only the fields YA needs and any unavailable or changed response
degrades to null.

Codex CLI `0.147.0` exposes single- and multi-bucket rate-limit snapshots,
account token-activity reads, and account identity reads.
The general `codex` bucket is provider-wide; named buckets are model-scoped
only when their provider label resolves to a current catalog model. Existing
`account/rateLimits/updated` events remain non-terminal telemetry and never
become synthetic turn errors.
