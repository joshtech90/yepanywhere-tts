Topic: transcript-virtualization

Status: Stage 1 removed the per-second O(rows) re-render. The Stage 2
`content-visibility: auto` experiment was retired on 2026-08-26 after confirmed
scroll-position failures and severe amplification in a real long-session
reload. The bounded semantic client data window is shipped. A measured-height
semantic render window landed on 2026-08-29 after a 360-turn profile still
settled at roughly 19,000 elements. Its accepted three-repetition browser trace
ended at eight mounted rows and 435 elements, with the exact latency and
trade-off record in the
[`2026-08-29 system-observed follow-up`](performance-regression-suite.runs/20260829-system-observed-followups.md).
Bounded whole-session isearch is also shipped: explicit continuation scans old
compact pages off the main thread, and committing an old result mounts only its
page as a disjoint semantic window.

2026-07-09 (follow-up, measured): **Stage 1 items 2–3 are moot, not
"re-prioritized."** Direct render-count instrumentation on the full-transcript
idle page (temporary `window.__mlRender`/`__riRender` counters + CDP profile)
showed `MessageList` re-renders **0.1/s** (item 1's memo holds) and
`RenderItemComponent` re-renders are a **one-shot settling burst** (identical
count over a 10 s and a 30 s window), not steady churn. So the row-map inline
arrows (item 2) are never recreated on idle, and `staleNowMs` is already gated
to the single latest-visible row (item 3). Items 2–3 target re-render churn
that measurement shows does not occur; they are at most defensive hardening for
a future where `MessageList` re-renders often again.

2026-08-23 (active-stream follow-up): the idle conclusion above still holds,
but active output is exactly the case where `MessageList` renders often again.
In a 7,543-element real-work tab, one changed live tail re-entered all 40
historical assistant galleries. The defensive boundary from items 2–3 is now
landed: projected render items, turn groups, and display rows retain identity,
and memoized user/assistant turn entries receive only row-local age state. A
40-turn text probe and a 20-turn explored-tool probe now enter only the changed
current turn. A post-fix real-tab trace during continued assistant text,
thinking, tool, and processing-typewriter updates recorded a 46.6 ms maximum
key-to-frame delay across 193 keystrokes, with no delayed keystrokes or long
tasks. One isolated frame gap reached 100.7 ms rather than the earlier sustained
200-plus-ms delays. That confirmation closed the associated active-stream
typing-latency gap.

The **actual** residual per-second re-render was elsewhere: the
`AgentContentContext` provider built a fresh `value` object every render, so
each SessionPage status-timer tick (~1/s) changed the context value and
re-rendered every subagent (`TaskRenderer`/`SpawnAgentRenderer`) consumer and
its nested rows *through* their `memo` boundaries (context bypasses `memo`).
Fixed 2026-07-09 by wrapping that value in `useMemo`
(`contexts/AgentContentContext.tsx`); the CPU profile's
`propagateParentContextChanges` / `formatAbsoluteTimestamp` idle hotspots
disappear after the fix. See `memory-growth.md` § *2026-07-09 follow-up*.

After that fix, idle transcript DOM is static (~1 mutation/s: only the
processing indicator), and the remaining steady idle cost is content-
visibility's cheap recalc-style re-evaluation. Measurement caveat: the shared
dev server's load/highlight timing is noisy; only quiescence-gated samples
(DOM-mutation rate below threshold before measuring) are trustworthy — a fixed
settle sometimes catches load-time shiki highlighting.

## Historical problem

Before Stage 1 and the measured-height render window landed, `MessageList`
mounted every loaded message as live DOM and the surrounding session tree could
re-enter large historical subtrees during active output. DOM footprint and
render work therefore scaled with transcript length; native browser memory
(Blink style/layout/paint and allocator high-water) could grow to many GB while
the V8 heap stayed flat. The current client instead combines a bounded semantic
data window with a measured-height mounted window. Full baseline evidence:
`memory-growth.md`.

## Measurement harness (reproduce before and after each stage)

Headless Chromium against a running server, loading the full transcript via
`?tailTurns=100000`, sampling on an **idle** page (no interaction, no
streaming). The signal is not heap size — it is **idle CPU-busy and
`RecalcStyleCount`/`LayoutCount` deltas that scale with row count**, plus
process-tree RSS trend. Key CDP calls:

- `Performance.getMetrics` → `RecalcStyleCount`, `LayoutCount`, `LayoutObjects`,
  `Nodes`, `JSEventListeners`, `ScriptDuration`, `TaskDuration` (diff two reads
  over an idle window; `TaskDuration/window` ≈ CPU-busy fraction).
- `Profiler.start/stop` → confirm `MessageAge`/`RenderItemComponent`/`jsxDEV`
  appear on an idle page (they must not, once fixed).
- `HeapProfiler.collectGarbage` before DOM-counter reads so counts are retained,
  not garbage.

Acceptance: idle full-transcript page should sit at ~0% CPU with no periodic
row rendering; RSS should plateau, not trend up, over a multi-minute idle hold.
(Baseline before fix: 22% idle CPU at 1145 rows; target: ≪1%.)

## Stage 1 — stop the per-second whole-transcript re-render (low risk)

Cheap, behavior-preserving. Do these, then re-measure:

1. **Stabilize `MessageList`'s props** so its `memo` actually holds across a
   SessionPage per-second re-render. Confirmed unstable inline arrows:
   `getComposerDraft` (`SessionPage.tsx:4544`), `onCancelForkSummary` (`:4580`),
   `onToggleForkSummaryAutoOpen` (`:4583`). Wrap in `useCallback` (the functions
   they call — `cancelForkSummaryJob`, `setForkSummaryAutoOpen` — are already
   stable; `getComposerDraft` reads a ref, deps `[]`). Audit the remaining
   `MessageList` props for any other per-render-fresh value; the memo only holds
   if *all* props are stable.
2. **[MEASURED MOOT 2026-07-09] Stabilize the row-map inline arrows** in
   `MessageList` (~lines 2341, 2348, 2353): the conditional
   `() => onTrimBeforeUserMessage(item.id)` etc. These are only recreated when
   `MessageList`'s body re-runs, and item 1 makes that ~0.1/s on idle, so the
   arrows are stable-in-practice and cost nothing on an idle page. Worth doing
   only as defensive hardening (so a future change that re-renders `MessageList`
   often does not resurrect the churn) — not a current win.
3. **[MEASURED MOOT 2026-07-09] Decouple per-row clocks.** Already effectively
   done in code: `getRenderItemStaleNowMs` (`lib/sessionDetail/timeline.ts`)
   returns `undefined` for every row except the one whose timestamp equals
   `latestVisibleTimestampMs`, so only that single row receives the live
   `nowMs`; the broadcast this item worried about does not exist. The only
   residue is that `buildTimelineEntryDisplayRows` rebuilds on the 30 s
   `useRelativeNow` tick — a 30 s cadence, not per-second.
4. Re-measure with the render-count probe (below). **Done 2026-07-09:**
   `MessageList` 0.1/s, `RenderItemComponent` one-shot settling — no steady row
   re-renders. The residual re-render was the `AgentContentContext` value (item
   5), not any broadcast prop value.
5. **[LANDED 2026-07-09] Memoize the `AgentContentContext` value.** This was the
   real per-second re-render source. The provider (`contexts/
   AgentContentContext.tsx`) rebuilt its `value` object every render; it
   re-renders on every SessionPage status-timer tick (~1/s), and context
   propagation re-renders all subagent consumers (`TaskRenderer`,
   `SpawnAgentRenderer`, and their nested rows) *through* `memo`. Wrapped in
   `useMemo` keyed on its contents (all deps already stable on idle:
   `agentContent`/`toolUseToAgent` are memoized upstream in
   `useSessionMessages`, `loadAgentContent`/`isLoading` are `useCallback`).
   Behavior-preserving.

**Why 2–3 turned out moot (not merely deferred):** the earlier note assumed a
per-second, O(rows) transcript re-render survived item 1. Direct measurement
falsified that — item 1's memo holds and the per-row clock is already gated. The
residual idle re-render was context-driven (item 5), which prop/clock
memoization cannot touch. Items 2–3 stay open only as optional hardening; they
do not block Stage 2 and do not reduce measured idle cost today.

Stage 1 does not bound the DOM — a very long session is still a large static
DOM — but it removes the per-second O(N) churn, which is the growth engine.

## Stage 2 — bound rendered cost to the viewport

Goal: a very long transcript should cost the browser (Blink style/layout/paint/
raster memory, and any per-tick layout) only for what's near the viewport, not
for the whole history.

### Retired experiment: `content-visibility: auto`

Experimented 2026-07-09; default rejected 2026-07-10.

Initial decision: realize Stage 2 first with CSS `content-visibility: auto` on
transcript rows (plus `contain-intrinsic-size: auto <estimate>`), **not** JS row
unmounting.
Rationale — the hard part of JS windowing is that every coupling below assumes
rows stay in the DOM; `content-visibility: auto` keeps the DOM intact and only
tells the browser to skip rendering work (and discard rendered state) for
off-screen subtrees. So it bounds the native-memory / layout cost — the actual
defect — while the turn rail's rect reads, in-transcript search `scrollIntoView`,
selection/comment anchors, and native find-in-page keep working unchanged. It is
~a few lines of CSS versus a large, risky refactor, and was expected to be
behavior-preserving. `contain-intrinsic-size: auto Xpx` gives off-screen rows a
placeholder height and remembers the real size after first render, keeping the
scrollbar stable.

Landed 2026-07-09 (`.message-render-row` in `index.css`). Measured at 1532 rows:
layout objects ~70,100 → ~2,750, RSS ~970 → ~820 MB, DOM node count unchanged.
Verified couplings held: turn-rail markers stay distributed and click-to-jump
scrolls correctly (rail reads still work because the DOM is intact), initial
scroll-to-bottom works, and paint containment did **not** clip the age chip or
hover quote circles.

Measured tradeoff: idle style-recalc roughly doubled (content-visibility state is
re-evaluated on each of the ~7.5 per-second widget-driven layouts), so idle CPU
on the full transcript rose ~9% → ~16%. This is amplification of the residual
per-second widget churn, not new work of its own — Stage 1 items 2–3 (stop those
per-second layouts) remove both the residual and this amplification, so they are
the natural next step. `contain-intrinsic-size: auto 120px` (auto remembers real
heights) measured the same idle cost as a fixed size but gives better scroll
stability, so it is the shipped form.

Residual risk still to watch in real use (not a headless-provable): scroll-
position drift as far-off-screen intrinsic estimates correct to real heights on
first scroll-through; `auto` minimizes it. If it janks in practice, add height-
model marker placement (below) rather than reaching for full unmounting.

2026-07-10 follow-up: a completed Codex session on the hosted mobile client
reported repeated downward scroll corrections during its first upward traversal,
then stability after roughly ten corrections. That symptom matches the residual
risk above: each row starts with the 120px fallback, then records its real height
when it first becomes relevant. A browser-local, default-on Performance setting
scoped the CSS optimization so the same device and session could disable it for
a direct A/B check. Disabling it fixed the regression, including for the short,
finished session. That falsifies the behavior-preserving premise: variable row
heights and bottom-anchored transcript scrolling make first-reveal geometry
corrections user-visible.

Decision: default the experiment off immediately. The ~150 MB RSS reduction
measured above does not justify fighting the reader's scroll position, and the
experiment does not bound retained transcript data.

2026-07-10 explored-rendering hardening: grouped exploration rows publish a
bounded intrinsic-height estimate derived from their visible entry/detail-row
count, capped at the group's existing scrollable-body height.

2026-08-26 retirement: a 45,103-message Codex session reopened with the
experiment enabled at 3,461 rendered rows and roughly 178,000 DOM elements.
The tab spent about 60% of its observed lifetime in long tasks, with frame gaps
up to 11.9 seconds, while intrinsic-height correction also left the reader at
the start of the compact tail. After disabling the experiment and remounting
against the bounded active window, the page held 310 rows and roughly 13,750
elements, with a 237 ms worst frame gap. The row reduction came from the active
window rather than CSS, but the experiment amplified the unbounded state and
made scroll recovery unreliable. The comparison toggle, preference plumbing,
and transcript CSS were removed; no runtime path now enables this experiment.

### Shipped bounded semantic client window

Do not hide an unbounded transcript behind estimated-height spacers. Keep the
full transcript canonical on the server and model the active client transcript
as a contiguous, recent semantic window. Drop an older prefix only at safe turn
boundaries, retain pagination metadata, and expose omitted history through the
existing Load older path. The approved first implementation deliberately uses
semantic compaction/turn limits rather than a byte bound; one unusually large
retained turn may therefore remain large. Trimming must also prune
message-associated augment and tool/agent maps.

This direction is shipped. Its original tactical contract is
[`060-bounded-active-transcript-window.md`](../docs/tactical/060-bounded-active-transcript-window.md):
default-on with a Performance setting to disable it, only while following the
bottom, a greater-than-60-second boundary-age guard, two-compaction retention,
30-to-20 turn hysteresis, and mount-scoped suppression after Load older.

Implement it against:

- [`memory-growth.md`](memory-growth.md), which distinguishes bounded initial
  loading from growth of the active client tail;
- [`Session Catch-up Must Not Fetch Full Transcripts`](../docs/tactical/055-session-catchup-unbounded-fetch.md),
  which defines the server/catch-up bounding invariant and explicit full-history
  escape hatch;
- [`session-detail-data-layer.md`](session-detail-data-layer.md), whose canonical
  reducer and loaded-window metadata are the natural ownership boundary; and
- the earlier [`initial-load performance investigation`](../docs/tactical/033-session-initial-load-performance.md),
  which already warned that `content-visibility` risked scroll height, browser
  find, selection, and search anchors.

This data bound and the render window below compose. The data window limits
what the client retains; the render window limits live DOM for the loaded rows
without hiding or dropping them from search and navigation.

### Whole-session search across a bounded window

Ctrl+R, Ctrl+S, and Ctrl+Alt+S initially search only the loaded semantic
window. When older durable history exists and the query has at least two
characters, the search panel offers **Search older**, then **More**. Each
button activation reads exactly one existing compact session page. Repeating
the active search shortcut, or pressing Up while the oldest current match is
selected, instead reads successive older pages until it finds the nearest new
match, reaches the beginning, or exhausts the browser-local Performance limit
for one keyboard attempt. That limit defaults to 100 pages. One page is one
bounded session-detail response and normally spans at most two compaction
boundaries; it is not a fixed message count. A lazily loaded Web Worker compiles
each page through the canonical transcript and Conversation View projections
and applies the active scope, query, case, and Thinking visibility. The main
thread retains only stable match ids, target ids, short previews, timestamps,
and source-page cursors; it does not merge scanned page bodies into the active
session store.

One page returns at most 200 matches and one search retains at most 512. A
truncated page or aggregate limit stops continuation and asks the reader to
refine the query. Changing query, case, scope, projection, or session
invalidates the old excerpts. If ordinary pagination was already in flight,
newly loaded ids supersede duplicate excerpts while continuation keeps moving
toward older history. Closing search terminates its worker and releases the
excerpt set. Before explicit continuation, ordinary transcript use and
loaded-window search perform no history request, worker construction, or
historical-page compilation.

An unhydrated historical result is deliberately preview-only. It has no turn
rail marker and no estimated transcript coordinate: a page-local height would
misrepresent its position across omitted history. Committing the selected
result refetches that result's page and mounts that one page before the recent
loaded tail. An explicit unloaded-history marker separates them when an
intervening region remains; an adjacent page joins without claiming an
omission. The result's stable render id then enters the measured-height render
window; after the React commit, the normal reveal and settled real-row geometry
own centering. Closing isearch preserves that row while nonmatching rows expand
around it, so the selected anchor does not move under the reader.

Only one historical page is mounted. It is outside the canonical active
session store, and trim, fork, and store-backed copy actions are unavailable on
its turns. Ordinary older-page controls and automatic pagination stay suspended
while this disjoint page is mounted, so a visible historical target cannot
trigger background prepends that move it. **Follow**, Ctrl+End, a session
change, or a Conversation View state change removes it and returns to the
recent tail. The compact-page semantic bound still permits one unusually large
turn; whole-session indexing remains a possible later optimization if that real
case justifies a separate index and consistency contract. Cross-session
indexing remains independently scoped in
[`all-session-content-search.md`](all-session-content-search.md).

### Measured-height semantic render window

`MessageList` keeps every loaded timeline row in its semantic model but mounts
only the viewport, 1.25 viewports of overscan, and at most 48 ordinary rows.
Windowing activates only at 200 units of semantic render weight, so the short
session path keeps its original DOM. One top-level user, assistant, standalone,
or `/btw` row is the identity and measurement unit; an assistant row's weight
includes its display subrows. A single unusually large turn can therefore
remain larger than the ordinary bound.

Off-window runs become spacer elements. Boundary markers measure mounted row
heights, keyed by stable timeline-row keys; unmeasured rows use a fixed
weight-based estimate. Before a window shift or height-model correction, the
first visible render-row anchor is captured and restored in the layout phase.
Follow-bottom remains owned by `MessageList` rather than the window hook.

Every render id maps to its owning semantic row and cumulative height-model
offset. Search, recall, route restoration, keyboard turn navigation, and turn
rail marker clicks can therefore position an unmounted target, mount its row,
and settle on the real DOM geometry. `UserTurnNavigator` uses live rects when a
row is mounted and height-model offsets otherwise. Progressive initial render
still controls which semantic rows are available; once their aggregate weight
crosses the threshold, the render window bounds the mounted subset.

Comment anchors record their owning render id and copy-source index. Rows with
live quote anchors are retained as sparse semantic islands even when the main
viewport window moves elsewhere, preserving DOM-backed tint ranges without
mounting the intervening transcript. Disclosure state remains in the existing
remembered-disclosure registry, outside row component lifetime, so unmounting a
row does not reset explicit activity/tool disclosure.

The 2026-08-29 unit contract covers the 48-row bound, waking a distant requested
turn, virtual turn-rail geometry, short-session DOM identity, older-page
chunking, scroll/snapshot behavior, and retaining a distant live quote anchor.
The same-day system trace reduced the 360-turn final state from 722 mounted
rows, 18,985 elements, and roughly 26,500 layout objects to eight rows, 435
elements, and 451–454 layout objects. Yielded older-history work completed
without a multi-second task or control timeout; its longest tasks were
118–127 ms. Tooltip long-task time fell from 186–299 ms to zero. Full-mode
scroll frame p95 rose from 16.8 to 33.4 ms without a long task, and the
Conversation scroll's numeric starting edge changed as measured heights
settled; those accepted limitations remain explicit in the report while row
anchor preservation and wake behavior remain unit-contract requirements.

## Non-goals

- Not a replacement for `tailTurns` load bounding — that limits what the server
  *sends*; virtualization limits what the browser *renders*. They compose:
  virtualization lets the default load window grow back without a memory cost.
- Not prompt caching, offline, or cross-route retention (that is
  `client-route-retention.md`).
