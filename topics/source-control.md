Topic: source-control

The original implementation grew out of
[Source Review → New Session](source-review-to-session.md). That topic remains
the contract for line-comment anchors, persistent review drafts, relocation,
submission, and review-session handoff. This topic is the current landing site
for behavior that belongs to Source Control generally: its modes, repository
navigation, master-detail layout, changed-file rows, diff controls, search,
compatibility shell, and links to relevant sessions. The old topic retains its
combined implementation record for historical context; where its page-wide UI
statements conflict with this topic, this topic governs.

## Product boundary

Source Control is primarily an inspection and agent-direction surface, not a
full git client. Check refreshes remote-tracking observation; fast-forward-only
Pull and explicit Push are the narrow established repository mutations.
Staging, committing, amending, discarding, branch surgery, stash mutation,
integration, conflict resolution, and recovery remain agent work unless a
separate proposal justifies one operation's preconditions, feedback, and
recovery.

Every Git subprocess launched through Source Control disables Git's optional
locks. Passive status, diff, history, and file observation must not
opportunistically refresh the index or briefly create `.git/index.lock` while
an agent or the user is doing concurrent Git work. Explicit Pull, Push, and
review-object mutations still take every lock Git requires for correctness.

The navigation surface has these modes:

- **Changes** is the default quick check and owns both the current
  HEAD-to-filesystem state and commit history. **Working tree status** is its
  normal landing at every repository state. A browser-local preference may
  instead select the newest commit when the repository is clean; Working tree
  remains available as a pinned revision.
- **Files** searches tracked paths and opens file content immediately, then
  enriches its blame column asynchronously when provenance becomes available.
- **Pending Comments** is the unsubmitted accumulator owned by
  [Source Review → New Session](source-review-to-session.md). Its stable URL
  key remains `comments`, preserving existing `?tab=comments` links.
- **Reviews** is the submission and comment-site browser owned by that topic.
  Its URL key is `reviews`; it shows frozen reviewer entries, captured source,
  target sessions, outcomes, and open/addressed/resolved state as those
  contracts become available. The added fourth mode means the wrapping rule
  in *Header hierarchy* below must be re-verified at phone width rather than
  assumed to still fit.

Normal Source Control navigation opens Changes with Working tree selected. A
clean repository renders its quiet clean-state confirmation at desktop and
phone widths; a dirty repository renders its changed files. The browser-local
**When the working tree is clean** preference may choose **Latest commit**
instead of the default **Working tree status** landing. If the repository has
no commits, the clean Working tree confirmation remains the fallback.

A user-selected mode pushes a browser-history entry. Back from Pending Comments
or Reviews therefore restores the preceding Source Control mode; a direct entry
at `?tab=comments` still backs out of Source Control rather than inventing an
internal predecessor. Phone commit-detail history remains a separate nested
interaction.

The preference applies only when navigation did not already identify an
explicit source target. The detail-level **‹ Commit history** parent link,
legacy `?tab=commits` URL, and `?history=1` open history inside Changes; a
`?rev=<sha>` deep link selects its commit. A working-tree file link adds
`?worktreeFile=<path>`; a committed-file link combines `?rev=<sha>` with
`?commitFile=<path>`. Both select the named file's diff as soon as its corpus is
available, including the phone drill-in flow.

The pinned Working tree row remains available in history and reflects its
actual state: clean uses calm success/neutral treatment and explicit clean
copy, while dirty uses warning treatment with its changed-file count. Selected
commit detail identifies only the commit; repository cleanliness remains in
the Source Control identity header and is not repeated as commit metadata.

Desktop uses master-detail panes once history is open; phone layouts drill
from revisions to files to a full-screen diff and restore the prior list
position on Back or back-swipe. The pinned Working tree behaves like any other
revision: desktop keeps it selected beside the history list, while phone opens
its detail with **‹ Commit history** returning to that list. The top-level
Changes tab reapplies the status-sensitive landing; the Dirty badge restores
the standalone Working tree landing.

## Header hierarchy

Project selection, branch, upstream, ahead/behind state, and the Clean/Dirty
badge form the Source Control identity cluster. Changes/Files/Pending
Comments/Reviews is the trailing mode selector. Pull, Push, Check remote, and
Comments form one repository-action group in that fixed order.

On a wide layout, repository actions occupy the title row between identity and
the trailing modes only when the rendered intrinsic widths of all three groups
fit. A `ResizeObserver`-backed measurement responds to identity, capability,
count, and viewport changes; a viewport breakpoint does not infer that fit.
When they do not fit, identity and modes retain the upper row and repository
actions take a full-width fallback row below it. Constrained layouts give the
mode selector and repository actions full-width rows. The same control
instances move between placements rather than being duplicated.

The branch name in the identity cluster is navigation to the commit that branch
points at — `recentCommits[0]`, the current `HEAD` tip. It is a real anchor with
a standalone `?rev=<sha>` URL, so middle-click, modifier-click, and “open in new
tab” work, while plain left-click stays in the current tab. A detached `HEAD`
keeps its detached label and still opens and copies that tip SHA. The copy
control stays beside the name: the name click navigates, the icon copies. A
server without the Source Control browser leaves the name inert rather than
linking to a view it cannot render.

Comments always opens Pending Comments, including when drafts exist; submission
remains on that pane. In the full-width fallback, Comments stays at the trailing
edge while Pull, Push, and Check remote remain left-anchored. Branch names,
upstream names, count badges, action progress, and action outcomes must not move
the Pull/Push/Check group. Their visible labels stay constant while a leading
action glyph changes in place to present progress and brief success/warning
state. Full action feedback remains visible below the header. The project
selector retains its intrinsic width, up to its desktop cap, before branch and
upstream text yield space; ordinary short project names must not truncate while
unused header space remains.

A successful fast-forward Pull reports the number of commits by which the
local branch advanced, or **Already up to date** when `HEAD` did not move. A
successful Push to an existing upstream reports the pre-push ahead count that
the action advanced; publishing a new branch remains **Branch published**.
Commit counts are optional additive response data under the existing Pull and
Push contracts. Clients receiving an older response without the count retain
the generic **Pull complete** or **Pushed commits** feedback and make no
different request.

## Workbench geometry

Source Control is a workbench, not prose or a transcript. It must use the
available page width after ordinary page padding and must not inherit the
Appearance **Max Content Width** measure globally or on its detail panes. The
revision, changed-files, diff, and blame tracks may use all available width.

On wide layouts, the browser region fills the page space remaining after the
actual Source Control header, notices, and action feedback. Lists and
diff/blame panes own their internal scrolling. Fixed viewport deductions such
as `100vh - 220px` are not the product contract, and the blank space they
currently create is not reserved for later content. Phone layout may continue
using normal page and full-screen-modal scrolling.

### Pane splitters

Changes exposes revision/files and files/diff boundaries while history is
open, and exposes its direct files/detail boundary for the default Working
tree. Files exposes its files/detail boundary. Matching top and bottom handles
resize the same boundary, remain keyboard-operable, and stay absent from phone
layout.

The changed-files pane has no arbitrary fixed maximum such as 500 px. It may
grow until the inter-pane gap and splitter handles would cease to remain fully
visible and operable; do not reserve an unrelated minimum width for the detail
pane. The user naturally stops after exposing as much path text as desired,
and the still-visible splitter is the recovery path from an extreme choice.

A content-derived natural maximum is optional, not required. If added, compute
it from the widest untruncated row in the **complete file corpus**, including
status, count, and menu affordances—not only rows currently mounted in the
vertical-scroll window. Recompute it when the corpus or relevant font, size,
or spacing metrics change.

### Changed-file state and path recovery

Changed-file rows use the compact git status code as the primary kind:
`M` = Modified, `A` = Added, `D` = Deleted, `R` = Renamed, and `?` =
Untracked. Less common codes retain the same treatment: `C` = Copied, `T` =
Type changed, and `U` = Unmerged. Tooltips and accessible labels expand every
code.

Do not repeat the long, visually similar **unstaged** or **untracked** words on
ordinary rows: the status code already carries the useful distinction, with
unstaged as the ordinary dirty state and `?` identifying untracked files. A
compact check may identify a fully staged file. When a file has staged changes
plus additional unstaged changes, use the explicit short label **partial**
rather than the opaque `±`; its tooltip says “Partially staged: staged changes
plus additional unstaged changes.”

Compact untracked directories remain outline groups as their existing bounded
background scan returns children. A group with more than ten loaded children
starts collapsed; smaller groups start expanded. Expanded child labels omit the
shared parent while the row tooltip and action identity retain the canonical
full path. The scan reports loaded/total directory progress, and search reveals
matching children already received without overwriting a user's collapsed
state. Clearing the query restores that state. Unloaded children remain outside
search coverage until the current server enumeration returns them; the progress
signal is the visible completeness boundary.

Working-tree changes, commit revisions, and Files use one shared file-row/path
treatment. A case-insensitive search match is highlighted and held visible: the
leading prefix yields from its start and the suffix consumes the remaining live
row width. A truncated path exposes its full value from the actual row
hover/focus target in both Native and Themed tooltip modes; a nested `title`
that happens to work in only one mode is not sufficient. Desktop row menus
overlay the trailing edge instead of reserving permanent path width. Touch
layouts keep the menu target in flow and preserve more path identity in the row
itself rather than depending on hover.

### Diff gutter

Added/deleted line backgrounds remain subdued while the `+` / `−` strip carries
the stronger semantic color. The authored gutter is about 16 px wide with a
roughly 6 px inline inset and separate breathing room between the color divide
and source text.

Source Control and session Edit-tool diffs use the same gutter-alignment class;
neither surface may keep a separately tuned approximation. The same shared
boundary owns the diff-specific Shiki palette. Each shipped theme uses fixed,
uniform added and removed line fills, and every syntax token has at least 3.5:1
contrast against both fills. This deliberately softer threshold keeps syntax
roles distinct from ordinary body text while preventing illegible combinations
such as a dim comment on a tinted line. Contrast is audited from the theme
palette offline, never inferred from the current file's content. Highlighted
and fallback renderers retain the contract in unified and side-by-side modes.
The stronger `+` / `−` gutter tints have separately audited foregrounds at the
same minimum, including the session fixed-font rendered form.

Source text is source text regardless of entry point. Source Control diffs,
session Edit-tool diffs, Files content, and blame use the same fixed-font
family, size, and line-spacing tokens derived from Appearance settings.
Individual source surfaces may add local density offsets, but may not substitute
a separately sized or spaced monospace style.

## Navigation and diff controls

One selected row drives the adjacent detail. Identity and state stay visible
in list rows; primary quick actions belong in the selected detail banner; one
shared ellipsis/context menu discloses the full action set. Right-click,
long-press, the visible ellipsis, and Shift+F10/Menu open the same accessible
menu with focus return and keyboard traversal.

When the selected commit has a body, its message card begins with the complete,
wrapping subject even though the detail banner retains its compact ellipsized
copy. The subject is preserved verbatim; only likely manual prose wrapping in
the commit body is folded to the pane width. Its text is selectable; mouse
activation opens the verbatim message only when the release did not complete a
selection, while Enter and Space remain keyboard activation. Phone detail keeps
the full subject above its compact full-message action. **‹ Commit history** is
styled as an actionable parent link rather than a full-width section label.

Source lists support Up/Down selection, Enter drill-in, Escape return, and `/`
to focus search when focus is outside an editor. Diff navigation supports
previous/next hunk and a visible current-hunk indicator. Browser shortcuts must
not copy native GitHub Desktop accelerators that collide with browser tabs,
Find, or the address bar.

Unified/Split and full-context controls stay in the diff pane. Ignore
whitespace is an independent projection of the active working-tree, commit, or
selected-revision-to-HEAD diff. Selected revision → HEAD uses a fixed selected
tree as base and a pinned HEAD SHA as tip; every file request stays on those
returned endpoints so a later HEAD move cannot mix comparisons.

A comparison comment cites the endpoint that contains the clicked projection:
an old-side line anchors to the fixed base SHA and a new-side line anchors to
the pinned tip SHA. An ordinary one-commit diff uses that commit SHA for both
sides; a working-tree diff remains uncommitted. Rendered diff lines are
interactive on their first visible frame—first-click commenting and hunk keys
do not depend on a later passive effect. Pending-comment tint uses revision,
side, and line identity so similarly numbered lines in another projection do
not inherit it.

Full context is a view of the current diff, not a file-path cache entry. If a
live working-tree refresh changes the diff while full context is open, YA
invalidates and reloads that projection. An older request resolving later
cannot overwrite the newer projection.

A diff-only/full-context switch preserves the first changed row's current
viewport offset rather than centering that row. Source Control and session Edit
details share both this scroll-anchor primitive and the unified diff renderer,
so the hunk remains visually stationary while surrounding source and the
scrollbar appear.

A live working-tree refresh preserves the user's selected Diff/Markdown
Preview mode and maintains the viewed position on a best-effort basis. Until
the aligned source-marker projection exists, preserving the relative scrollbar
position is sufficient. If one refreshed response cannot supply Markdown
preview content, YA temporarily shows the source diff without clearing the
user's preview choice; preview resumes when a later response can render it.

Source Control presents a text diff only when the exact Git projection is not
classified as binary and both file versions are safe UTF-8 text. Git attributes
that mark a tracked path binary are authoritative; a filename extension alone
is never authoritative in either direction. Binary working-tree, staged,
commit, and selected-revision comparison files show a bounded skipped-preview
state with the path and size when known, and their bytes never enter syntax
highlighting. Untracked files receive the same treatment from their content.
A current client also suppresses binary-looking structured patch text returned
by an older server. Large-content, long-line, and highlighted-HTML limits remain
independent reasons to omit a text preview.

Markdown Preview follows the explicit diff/full-context scope. Diff-only uses
the same approximate diff-aware rich-text projection as session Edit details,
including added/removed/context lanes. Full context renders the complete
post-change document and may sacrifice changed-block emphasis for a faithful
whole-file render. Copy content follows that same scope. Exact source-line
identities, aligned blocks, and the cross-representation scroll contract live in
[aligned Markdown diffs](aligned-markdown-diffs.md).

The wide diff pane keeps filename, path, view controls, hunk navigation, and
file actions in one toolbar row when they fit. A narrow pane or phone modal may
use a compact second row. The filename is the primary identity: it uses compact
source type and retains its full text before the directory path spends
remaining width. The smaller directory prefix precedes it and, when clipped,
keeps its rightmost segment next to the filename. Toolbar actions use compact
glyphs with complete hover and accessible names; hunk position uses the
language-neutral `current/total` form.

Ignore whitespace uses the conventional open-box space glyph `␣`. Its compact
button is outlined when off and accent-filled when pressed; the selected state
must not depend on interpreting the glyph or a subtle tint.

Each commit and working-tree changed-file pane exposes one compact file-filter
disclosure. Opening its magnifier expands a case-insensitive local path search
across the pane's current corpus, including both sides of a rename and every
untracked child returned so far by folder enumeration. New arrivals pass through
the active query. The loaded/total scan signal discloses when Working tree
coverage is incomplete; searching unloaded children awaits a future inventory
contract. On wide layouts, the first visible file becomes the detail when the
prior selection no longer matches; no match leaves an explicit empty result.

### File-viewer projections

Every project file viewer may expose two exact Git projections in its header.
**vs HEAD** compares the current `HEAD` tree to the live filesystem. **vs
HEAD^1** is cumulative: it compares the first parent of `HEAD` to the live
filesystem, so it includes both the current commit and any staged, unstaged,
or untracked work. It is not the commit-only `HEAD^1`-to-`HEAD` diff. A
worktree edit that exactly cancels the current commit's change therefore
removes that path from the cumulative corpus.

A selector exists only when its complete project-wide Git projection contains
the path. A clean path has no **vs HEAD** selector; a root commit has no **vs
HEAD^1** selector; a path with neither net diff has no selector at all.
Renames match either the old or new path and render as one file projection.

The shared project-file link is the access point in prose and structured
Read/Edit turns. Hovering the filename reveals the available projections
beside it; keyboard focus reveals the same links. Touch relies on the viewer
header. Each target is a real anchor with a standalone URL, so middle-click,
modifier-click, and browser context-menu opening work normally.

Selecting a projection replaces the source body in the existing file viewer.
While a diff is active, source line and line-range requests are inapplicable:
the diff URL omits `line`, `lineEnd`, and `view=range`, and the viewer neither
loads nor highlights that source window. Returning to **Source** restores the
original source range. Diff rendering retains full-context, unified/split,
Markdown-preview, hunk-navigation, and review-projection behavior from the
shared Source Control renderer.

The permanent `git-file-diff-projections` capability owns
`GET /api/projects/:projectId/git/file-projections` and
`POST /api/projects/:projectId/git/file-projection-diff`. Without it the
client hides all of these selectors and makes no projection request. Existing
Source Control capability meanings do not expand.

## Search and compatibility

Files search owns the complete tracked-path corpus up to the explicit 10,000
file bound; rendering may window results but must not turn that window into a
search-coverage limit. Commit-delta search builds an on-demand client corpus
from lightweight history plus bounded changed-path/line batches. Once a corpus
is present, typing performs no network request and starts no git process.
Browser-lifetime reuse is implemented; IndexedDB reuse across browser restarts
remains optional future work. Focused completions and rendered match-context
tooltips remain pending.

Files starts its ordinary project-file request and blame request independently.
Readable content renders as soon as the file request returns; the view never
holds it behind `git blame`. Until blame resolves, the gutter shows inert
placeholders and line commenting waits for a provenance anchor. Blame then
fills commit-hash links in place and may add highlighting without resetting the
file selection or scroll context. Failure to load blame leaves readable content
visible with a provenance warning.

A committed hash opens that exact revision in Commits, including a revision
outside the recent page. Its tooltip shows the full SHA, author/date when
known, and commit summary. Right-click, long-press, and the shared keyboard menu
offer **Open commit** and **Copy commit hash**; copying uses the full SHA.
Uncommitted lines remain visibly non-link provenance. Pending blame-comment
tint matches both the line and its committed/uncommitted revision identity.

The blame grid has three real columns: a five-character displayed commit hash,
a content-sized line number, and selectable code. Clicking the line number or
clicking code without selecting it starts a review comment; completing a text
selection does not turn the release click into a review action. Consecutive
lines with the same populated blame provenance share one horizontal overflow
region. Different commits never share that scrollbar, and code cells do not
grow independent per-line scrollbars.

The path-copy icon sits beside the pathname. The detail banner's trailing
document-copy icon instead copies the exact raw text returned by the file
endpoint and remains disabled until readable text is available. Their icons,
tooltips, and accessible names distinguish path from content.

One-author files retain the ordinary gray hash. With multiple authors, hashes
receive distinct hues chosen by maximum minimum distance over the visible
author set. The server gives each author a durable project-wide hue preference
and refreshes the palette in the background when a project is opened or added;
new HEAD commits only scan the newly reachable range. A palette read, update,
or write error discards persisted detail and permits exactly one full-history
regeneration attempt, then omits server palette detail rather than retrying in
a loop. The client re-spaces the visible file's author set from those
preferences. When palette generation fails or an older server omits the
optional preference, a stable author-name hash supplies the preference without
an unsupported request.

Current source persists that palette at `.yep/git-author-palette.json` and
warms it merely when a project is opened or added. That post-`0.7.0` behavior
is audited but not the target contract: under
[Project Directory Storage](project-directory-storage.md), default project
browsing performs no project or Git-metadata write. The palette belongs in
memory or a central project-keyed cache unless project-local storage was
explicitly enabled.

Files caches the selected file's maximum intrinsic rendered code-line width by
project, path, content fingerprint, and the typography metrics that affect
measurement. On a wide layout, selection or a relevant viewport/typography
change targets the content pane at the blame gutter, line-number gutter,
scrollbar/border allowance, and that maximum line width—just enough to show the
file without gratuitous empty space—and leaves the remainder to the file list.

The allocator clamps to available space and existing pane minima. It may shrink
an oversized file list toward its ordinary default when that lets the content
fit, but uses a list the user manually narrowed below that default as its
automatic lower bound. A manual split remains in effect until file selection or
the measured viewport/typography changes. Phone layouts keep their full-screen
drill-in and do not run this two-pane allocation. Tests cover cache reuse and
invalidation, tabs/wide characters and empty files, wide-space allocation, and
constrained minimum-width fallback.

**Persist project-wide author preferences, then re-space the visible file**
(vs storing a final color per author): the durable preference keeps identity
stable while file-local maximum-distance assignment preserves useful
distinction for the usually small visible author set. Regenerating only after
an error keeps corrupt state recoverable without turning palette maintenance
into a background retry loop.

## Foreground diff latency

A working-tree file selection depends on its exact Git projection and renderer,
not on fresh provider-session aggregates. Once the project id has resolved in
the server's project snapshot, every Source Control path-only route may reuse
that known identity even after the aggregate snapshot's five-second freshness
window expires. A cold server may discover projects once; clicking a file after
the Changes list is visible must not synchronously rescan Claude, Codex, or
Gemini histories. Session/project inventory refresh remains owned by the
surfaces that consume that mutable inventory.

The working-tree diff endpoint reports `Server-Timing` phases named `project`,
`preflight`, `versions`, `render`, `projections`, and `total`, and emits the same
numbers in its debug event. This keeps future regressions attributable: a
simple file should spend only ordinary subprocess time in Git preflight/version
reads, while syntax highlighting or Markdown rendering is visible separately
as `render`. The file-diff request does not compute or fetch blame.

The comment-anchor projections only read `HEAD`, so they depend on nothing
else the request computes and run concurrently with it. Their phase is
therefore an overlapping wall-clock window, and the number is the time that
read was awaited rather than its exclusive share.

The binary classification stays strictly *before* the version reads, and a
later latency change must not parallelize the two. That ordering is what keeps
a binary file's bytes from being read into memory at all: the size-based
preview skip only covers untracked paths, so for a tracked binary the
classification is the sole guard, and speculating on the version reads
alongside it would trade a bounded skip for an unbounded read. The cost of
holding the order is one subprocess latency. Note that a response-level test
cannot catch a regression here — the classification still wins the race and
still returns the skip — so the guard is the ordering itself.

Syntax highlighting dominates the remaining cost — roughly 90µs per tokenized
line, and a whole file is tokenized per version. A version's content determines
its highlighting exactly, so the server retains highlighted output keyed by
content and language, bounded by total retained bytes. This is a pure function
of content and needs no invalidation window; do not add a time-based expiry
that would reintroduce the cost.

**No request pays whole-file tokenization.** Highlighting a whole file gives
the tokenizer exact context, but a request that has to compute it scales with
the file rather than with the change — for a ~2000-line source file that was
413ms of tokenizing. A diff therefore takes whichever it can have now: the
retained whole-file result when that is already paid for, otherwise an excerpt
of just the hunk lines, while scheduling the whole-file tokenization to land
after the response. The next read of that same version — the status-poll
refetch, a reselection, a whitespace or full-context toggle — is exact and
tokenizes nothing. Measured on that file: 413ms → 89ms first look → 9ms
thereafter.

Scheduled whole-file tokenizations are capped, because each one blocks the
loop while it runs and walking quickly through a changeset would otherwise
queue a long stall. Dropping one is safe — the request still has its excerpt,
and the next read of that version schedules it again.

The excerpt is what makes this a trade rather than a free win: tokenizing only
the hunk lines starts outside any string or comment that opened above them, so
a prose word inside a docstring can render keyword-coloured. That error is
therefore deliberately **transient** — it belongs only to the first look at a
version and must not become the steady state. A change here that removes the
background warm, or that serves the excerpt when the whole-file result is
cached, breaks the contract even though every response still parses.

Do not "fix" the first-look approximation by making the request wait for
whole-file tokenization; that is the 1.2s this replaced. Worker threads do not
substitute either: they would let the two versions tokenize in parallel, but
the common case has one cold version, so they buy no latency there — their
value is keeping a long tokenize off the loop that also serves live sessions.

Do not add speculative file-diff prewarming as the first remedy for a slow
selection. Eliminate unrelated project/session scans and measure the remaining
phases first. Prewarming the likely next file remains an optional latency
courtesy only if those measurements show a meaningful irreducible renderer
cost; it cannot become a correctness dependency or retain unbounded file
content.

### Selection cost is independent of corpus size

Entering Changes and selecting a file must cost what that one file's diff
costs. Two client-side rules keep it there, both of which a large working tree
otherwise breaks:

**Background enrichment yields to the foreground.** Compact untracked
directories expand through one server request each, and each of those is a
`git status --untracked-files=all` over that directory. A repository with
hundreds of untracked directories therefore has hundreds of them to run, so the
sweep is bounded well below the browser's per-host connection budget and its
arrivals are coalesced into periodic list updates. The status request and the
selected file's diff must never queue behind it.

**A changed-file row's object identity changes only when its state changes.**
The diff pane reloads when its `file` prop changes identity — that is how a
live working-tree refresh reaches an open diff, including when the summary
fields did not move. Rebuilding every row on each untracked-folder arrival
therefore recomputed the selected file's diff once per arrival. The merge that
produces rows reuses the previous object for any path whose state is unchanged,
and deliberately does not reuse across a new status snapshot, which is the
live-refresh signal itself.

The permanent `git-source-review` capability currently gates the complete
Changes/Files/Comments browser, including commit history inside Changes, as
well as the review endpoints. An
older server with only `git-status-enhanced` receives the basic status,
working-tree diff, and independently advertised Check/Pull/Push shell; the
client makes no unsupported browse/review requests. Ignore whitespace and
selected-revision-to-HEAD comparison remain gated by
`git-source-review-projections`. See
[server capabilities](server-capabilities.md) and
[`063-source-control-hosted-compatibility.md`](../docs/tactical/063-source-control-hosted-compatibility.md).

## Dirty-file last editor

The selected dirty file links to the **last YA session observed editing
it**. This reverses the existing bridge from a session Edit block into the exact
dirty file without pretending YA can reconstruct complete authorship. In
Changes, the selected file banner and shared file context menu expose one
compact session action when attribution exists; it navigates through the
canonical YA session id. Selecting a file starts no attribution query.

Git records no dirty-file session authorship. The deliberately bounded
contract is **the last session with a recorded edit**: a successful structured
file mutation YA observed in a canonical session—Edit, Write, `apply_patch`, or a
provider equivalent—whose normalized project-relative target is this path.
Do not infer an editor from active sessions, project membership, or file
mtime.

The server observes every owned provider process at the normalized
`tool_use`/`tool_result` boundary. It remembers a mutation proposal by tool id,
then records paths only when the paired result is not an error. `apply_patch`
parsing covers every Add, Update, Delete, Move, and unified-diff path in a
multi-file patch. Repeated completion-phase tool-use events do not replace the
earlier proposal. Provider adapters must mark declined or failed mutations as
error results; a proposed or failed edit never earns attribution.

One private server-owned JSON store retains a logical row per canonical project
path and normalized repository-relative file. A row carries only the canonical
YA session id and successful-result observation time. A later observed edit
replaces it, while a late completion with an older observation time cannot
overwrite newer attribution. There is no editor set, event history, tool id,
content hash, transcript backfill, or before/after lineage. The observer already
has project and session context, so Source Control must not run provider
discovery, session inventory, or `agent-mapping` work to construct the link.

Scripted commands are a deliberately best-effort supplement. For a bounded set
of recognizable write-shaped shell commands—redirection, common file mutation
primitives, patch/apply operations, and formatter/package-manager write
modes—the observer compares Git's dirty paths and filesystem fingerprints just
before and after a successful command. Only dirty paths whose fingerprint
changed are attributed. Arbitrary scripts, generators with unrecognized command
shapes, human edits, external processes, provider activity YA did not observe,
and fast writes racing the initial snapshot may remain unattributed. Concurrent
external writes during a recognized command can be misattributed. These gaps
are preferable to scanning Git around every read-only shell command or guessing
from active sessions.

A successful complete Git-status refresh is the clearing authority. Any stored
path absent from dirty status is deleted; a commit that leaves another staged or
unstaged change does not clear it. A failed or unavailable status read is not a
clean listing and never prunes attribution; it may decorate whatever rows are
available, but stored rows survive until an authoritative refresh. Compact
untracked-directory rows preserve stored child attribution until Git expands or
cleans that directory. The compact folder itself does not expose a child-session
link; its existing expansion response includes attribution for the individual
files. Reconciliation may wait until Source Control enters or refreshes the
project; restart does not walk all repositories. An unobserved writer can
therefore replace or revert the recorded session's contribution while leaving
the path dirty, so the action is worded as the last editing session and never
claims exact-byte authorship.

The permanent `git-dirty-file-editor` capability adds optional
`files[].lastEditor = { sessionId, observedAt }` data to the existing
status response. Servers without it retain the complete released Source Control
behavior; clients hide the session action and make no additional request.
Existing `git-status-enhanced` and `git-source-review` meanings do not grow.
