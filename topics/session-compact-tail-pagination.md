## Contract

For `GET /api/projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId?tailCompactions=N`,
the returned transcript window should start at the Nth compact boundary from
the end when at least N compact boundaries exist. The boundary message itself
is included so the client has an explicit "Context compacted" divider at the
top of the window.

If fewer than N compact boundaries exist, the endpoint returns the full
transcript. That preserves the intuitive "N compact windows" behavior for
short sessions: with `tailCompactions=2`, a session that has only one compact
boundary has only two windows total, so returning the beginning, the boundary,
and the current tail is acceptable.

For `tailCompactions=2`, the intended shapes are:

| Total compact boundaries | Returned shape |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | full session |
| 1 | beginning, `C1`, tail |
| 2 | `C1`, middle, `C2`, tail |
| 3 | `C2`, middle, `C3`, tail |
| 100 | `C99`, middle, `C100`, tail |

### Compact scope and turn selectors

An uncursored session-detail read is authorized to inspect only the last two
compaction windows by default. `tailTurns` and `tailFrom` select a smaller
suffix inside that compact scope; they do not authorize reading across its
older boundary. This distinction matters because one provider turn can contain
multiple compactions and thousands of normalized rows, so a turn count is not
itself a safe response-size bound.

The effective start is the later of the compact-boundary start and the
turn-selector start. Consequently, `tailTurns=20` means "up to twenty turns
within the authorized compact scope," not "return twenty turns even if that
crosses older compactions."

`fullHistory=1` is the explicit authorization to remove the default compact
scope. It may be combined with `tailTurns` or `tailFrom` so the server selects
a bounded suffix from the full transcript without sending the full transcript
to the client first. Without `fullHistory=1`, those selectors can only narrow
the default or explicitly requested compact window.

| Query | Effective scope |
| --- | --- |
| no query | last two compaction windows |
| `tailTurns=20` | up to 20 turns within the last two compaction windows |
| `tailFrom=<id>` | from the id only when that is later than the compact start; otherwise clamp to the compact start |
| `tailCompactions=5` | last five compaction windows |
| `fullHistory=1` | full transcript |
| `fullHistory=1&tailTurns=20` | last 20 turns across the full transcript |

`afterMessageId` remains an incremental cursor rather than an initial history
scope. If that cursor cannot be found, the route falls back to the default
two-compaction tail. `beforeMessageId` remains the explicit older-page cursor
and returns another compact-boundary-shaped page.

## Why This Matters

The previous boundary condition used `totalCompactions <= tailCompactions` as
the full-history case. That made a session with exactly two compact boundaries
return the initial prompt and all pre-compaction history for the default
`tailCompactions=2` request, then abruptly shrink once a third compaction
arrived.

That discontinuity is user-visible on long Codex sessions because provider
JSONL can expand a modest number of user turns into hundreds or thousands of
normalized render rows. A syntactically bounded `tailCompactions=2` request can
still be expensive if the exactly-two-boundary case returns the entire
transcript.

## Older-Page Pagination

`beforeMessageId` uses the same rule on the prefix before the cursor. If that
prefix contains at least N compact boundaries, the older page starts at the
Nth boundary from the end of that prefix and reports `hasOlderMessages: true`.
The next older-page request can then fetch the pre-boundary prefix. This may
make one additional older-page click necessary compared with the former full
prefix behavior, but it keeps every page shaped like the requested compact
tail.
