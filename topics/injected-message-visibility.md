# Injected-message visibility contract

How YA-injected, non-user text (control commands, compaction summaries, skill
contents, resume re-injection) is shown — or hidden — in the transcript UI.

See also: [`ui-architecture.md`](ui-architecture.md) (rendering boundary),
task 029 (per-model compact threshold, the first consumer of the hide path).

## Invariant

**YA-injected context-initialization text must not render as an ordinary user
or assistant turn.** When YA, rather than the user, puts text in front of the
agent to shape context — the `/compact` command it queues, a post-compaction
summary, a skill body, a resume-from-full re-injection — that text either
carries a system/compaction visibility contract (rendered as a boundary/system
item) or is hidden, but it is never a normal turn. The symptom this guards
against: a `/compact` user bubble, or a wall of skill/resume text, appearing as
if the user typed it.

## Single hide chokepoint (landed)

All hiding of injected user-role messages routes through **one** predicate so a
future "show hidden" UI can reveal them consistently instead of each call site
deciding ad hoc:

- `UserMessageMetadata.hidden?: boolean` (`packages/shared/src/user-message-metadata.ts`)
  is the only signal.
- `Process.isHiddenInjectedMessage(message)` (`packages/server/src/supervisor/Process.ts`)
  is the only reader. It gates the optimistic **user echo** in
  `queuePreparedMessage` (both the SSE-replay bucket push and the live emit) —
  and nothing else. It is deliberately **not** folded into `shouldEmitMessage`,
  which must stay an unconditional `return true` for provider-stream messages.
- Producer: `Supervisor.tryResumeCompaction` stamps `metadata.hidden` on the
  `/compact` it queues, so **both** resume-time compact-first and the task-029
  threshold trigger emit no `/compact` user turn — matching native
  auto-compaction, which shows none.

### Result vs. visibility contract

A YA-initiated compaction has two halves, both satisfied by reusing
`tryResumeCompaction`:

- **Result contract** — it drives a real `compact_boundary` system message,
  which the client renders as a collapsed "Context compacted" item
  (`preprocessMessages.ts`, system-subtype branch). Same as native.
- **Visibility contract** — the `/compact` command itself is hidden (above), so
  no spurious user bubble. Same as native.

Scope note: the hide path covers the **optimistic echo** (a YA-side SSE
broadcast, not the JSONL transcript). `/compact` as a recognized provider slash
command is not persisted as a user content turn, so suppressing the echo is
sufficient for the live path. If a provider ever did persist it, that becomes a
JSONL-classification problem — see Part 2.

## Part 2 — persisted injected rows

Some injected rows are **real JSONL transcript messages**, not optimistic
echoes, so the echo chokepoint above does not touch them. The fix is to
classify/tag injected context-init text in the reader/render pipeline so it
inherits the system/hidden contract.

### Claude compact summary (landed 2026-06-26)

Claude can persist a manual compact as a cluster of rows:

- `system/compact_boundary` with `compactMetadata`;
- a transcript-only `user` row carrying `isCompactSummary: true`;
- local-command caveat, `/compact` command, and stdout wrapper rows.

YA now treats that cluster as one collapsed compact boundary in the transcript.
The compact boundary survives reload even when the boundary only names its
preserved parent in `compactMetadata.preservedSegment` /
`compactMetadata.preservedMessages`; the summary is attached as expandable
detail. Local-command caveats and compact command/stdout wrappers are hidden
from the default view. The compact-summary text remains semantic context for
server-side restart/fork summarization when a selected window includes it, but
it is not a user-authored request.

### Claude slash-command skill body (landed 2026-06-26)

Claude can persist a skill-backed slash command as adjacent rows:

- a `user` row containing only `<command-message>`, `<command-name>`, and
  `<command-args>` XML tags;
- a following `user` row with `isMeta: true` and text-block content beginning
  `Base directory for this skill: ...`, followed by the skill body and
  `ARGUMENTS: ...`.

YA now treats that pair as one collapsed local-command system item. The
one-line header is the echoed slash command (for example
`/harsh-review last 10 commits`); the injected skill body remains available as
expandable detail, but does not render as a user bubble. Server-side user-turn
slicing also treats the skill body as synthetic, and fork-after source
validation rejects the body as a selected user-authored request.

### Codex resumed environment context (landed 2026-06-30)

Codex can persist a user-role `response_item` containing only
`<environment_context>...</environment_context>` immediately before the real
user turn that wakes a TUI-created session. YA now suppresses that lone
environment-context setup item when it is immediately followed by a normal user
prompt, so the context row does not render as a fictitious user turn.

### Codex startup instructions with plugin recommendations (landed 2026-07-09)

Codex can now prefix its persisted startup instruction user-role row with a
`<recommended_plugins>...</recommended_plugins>` block before
`# AGENTS.md instructions for ...`. YA treats that shape as the same injected
startup instruction row as the older plain `# AGENTS.md instructions for ...`
form: the durable reader suppresses it, and the client setup fallback collapses
it into `Session setup` rather than rendering it as a user-authored turn. The
Codex summary reader also skips the row when deriving the first-turn session
title; the session-summary index version advances with that interpretation so
already-cached plugin-prefixed titles are rebuilt after restart.

Remaining Part 2 scope: broader resume-from-full init text can still render as
normal turns. It predates the compaction work and needs its own classification,
not a local CSS hide.

## "Show hidden" — future exploration (no implementation yet)

Hidden turns are currently fully suppressed. The intended direction is to make
them **hyper-collapsed** (outline/modal, like the collapsed-system style, or
more) rather than fully gone, so the user keeps visibility into the effective
context — e.g. the system prompt / initial AGENTS-load result, recalled as once
showing as an expandable turn. The single hide chokepoint exists precisely so
this can be added in one place: flip "suppress" to "emit with a hidden marker"
and give the client one render path for hidden items.
