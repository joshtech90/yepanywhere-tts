Topic: file-source-editing

## Viewer behavior

Ordinary `.html` and `.htm` files open as rendered, scriptless previews. An
explicit Source choice still opens raw HTML. **Edit mode** opens a workspace
covering the session and sidebar without unmounting them. Desktop uses a
source/preview split; narrow screens switch between Source and Preview. The
HTML selection view is a static snapshot, including for an interactive artifact.
Clicking a mapped item or choosing it in the keyboard-accessible target list
opens the original file at its range's starting line and UTF-16 column. The
location is explicitly approximate; character-level click mapping is deferred.
Without supported targets, edit the HTML itself. Malformed targets show an error
and leave the original HTML available for direct editing.

The selection snapshot of an ordinary project HTML file loads no external
assets, so it renders unstyled. A play toggle above the target picker turns on
the **styled preview**: it obtains an artifact grant for the file, exactly as
the viewer's interactive mode does, and rebuilds the same scriptless snapshot
with that grant URL as its base, so the page's stylesheets, images, and fonts
load from the artifact origin under the snapshot's existing policy. Scripts,
forms, and frames stay stripped, and plain click still selects a mapped item;
no modifier is needed. The notice above the panes says which preview is
showing. The toggle is absent when the source already lives on the artifact
origin, whose snapshot has that base from the start, and when the artifact
viewer is unavailable. Shift-click on the toggle opens the fully interactive
viewer in a new tab as elsewhere. A live interactive pane inside the editor,
with a click bridge injected into the served artifact, is sketched in
[live-editor-preview-select](../gaps/sketches/live-editor-preview-select.md).

File and artifact viewers share a square pencil toggle for Edit mode. The same
pencil is highlighted while editing and exits through the dirty-close flow.
HTML files also have a matching play toggle for interactive preview, beside
Edit in the viewer header; its highlighted state means scripts are running on
the isolated artifact origin. While running, right-click on that toggle opens
a menu: open the grant in a new tab, **Copy public URL**, and **Stop
interactive preview**. The public URL is the file's public file share in play
form, the same link the File Viewer's share dialog copies while the preview
runs: an existing live file share is reused, otherwise one is minted. It
authorizes only that file and its directly referenced assets and is listed and
revocable in the share dialog. The menu never mints a public-audience artifact
grant, whose authority would cover the file's whole directory with no listing
or revocation. The entry follows the file-share conditions in
[relay-origin-and-share-gating](relay-origin-and-share-gating.md#public-file-views)
and is absent when the viewer opened the file without a project. Tooltips and accessible names
describe each action. Ordinary clicks toggle in place. Shift-click opens the requested mode
in a new tab; middle-click and the browser's Open link in new tab use the same
real link. These gestures leave the original pane and draft unchanged.

Mode links use authenticated `/file-view` (beneath the current relay prefix
when applicable), carrying the original file or artifact reference and mode.
They do not grant permission. Artifact URLs must match the current source's
configured isolated origins before embedding. New edit tabs retain the
`file-source-editing` gate; interactive tabs use the existing artifact gate.

Text and Markdown viewers expose **Edit**, using the supplied file/line location.
The editor saves only on explicit Save or Save and close. Leaving a dirty editor
offers Save, Discard, or Keep editing. Save errors retain the draft. Ordinary
text viewers reload after closing a saved editor. HTML previews remain frozen:
saving does not rebuild, reload the artifact, or update source-map coordinates.
The editor warns about this after saving. No notice is sent to an agent session.

The first editor supports UTF-8 text up to 1 MiB, preserves uniform LF or CRLF
line endings, and refuses mixed line endings, binary data, and hard-linked files.
HTML up to 200 MiB can supply the selection preview, but editing a mapped source
still uses the 1 MiB limit; large HTML itself is not put into a textarea.
The editor parses a received preview once, into its target list and one
sanitized selection snapshot, and keeps neither the received HTML nor the
parsed document; switching the styled preview re-derives the frame document
from that snapshot without parsing again. The remaining per-document cost is
recorded in [the large-preview gap](../gaps/source-editor-large-html-preview-copies.md).

## Initial HTML target convention

Producers place matched HTML comments around an item or sibling range:

```html
<!--# sourceMappingURL=report.html.map -->
<!-- ya-source-target:v1 {"id":"summary","source":"../sections/summary.qmd","sourceRange":[[2,0],[7,0]],"precision":"item"} -->
<p>Rendered summary.</p>
<!-- /ya-source-target:v1 summary -->
```

The coordinates are zero-based lines and UTF-16 columns, with half-open ranges.
`source` resolves relative to the annotated map's directory, or the HTML's
directory when no map annotation exists. Relative references use forward slashes;
absolute POSIX source paths are accepted. Map annotations must be relative file
references. Targets have unique ids and properly nested paired markers; the
smallest containing mapped target wins. Only real DOM comments count, never
comment-like strings in scripts. At most 10,000 targets are accepted.

This HTML spelling and target record are YA extensions, using the familiar
`sourceMappingURL` discovery spelling and source-map coordinate conventions.
They are not a browser HTML source-map standard. This increment reads original
`source`/`sourceRange` fields in comments; it does not fetch a sidecar, decode
version-3 VLQ mappings, consume `sourcesContent`, or infer source from text.
Generated-range-only records cannot locate an original source yet. The richer
[source-map sketch](../gaps/sketches/source-mapped-artifact-editing.md) remains
future work.

## Authority, compatibility, and conditional saves

The `file-source-editing` capability gates all Edit controls and requests.
Stable 0.8.1 and 0.9.0 lack it. Without it, clients retain viewing/commenting,
hide Edit, and make no `/api/file-edit` requests. Existing capabilities keep
their meanings. This additive contract was approved by the maintainer.

Authenticated GET `/api/file-edit` accepts a local/project path, a source path
relative to an allowed HTML file, or a currently valid configured artifact grant
URL. It returns canonical path, UTF-8 content, SHA-256 revision, and `editable`.
`preview=1` allows the larger HTML read. Artifact grants locate content; they
never grant source-edit permission. All resolved files must pass the existing
canonical local-file allow-set. Public shares expose no Edit action or write API.
[Limited users](limited-users.md#authorization) are refused every
`/api/file-edit` route with 403: the allow-set is host-wide, a `projectId`
does not scope the absolute paths the route accepts, and the rebuild route runs
a registered command outside any session sandbox. Opening the route to them
would first need a check of each canonical path against their granted project
roots.

PUT `/api/file-edit` takes `{path, revision, content}`. It checks the current
bytes against the revision and atomically replaces the file, preserving mode.
A stale revision, another browser save in progress, a detectable in-flight agent
write, or a hard link returns a conflict. An in-flight agent write is matched
by symlink-resolved path on both sides, so a project registered or opened
through a symlink still conflicts. Unknown external writers are not
filesystem-locked; a writer racing after the final comparison is not prevented.
No source backup or editor state is stored inside the project.

The selection iframe has an opaque origin and runs only YA's nonce-authorized
selection script. Producer scripts, handlers, forms, and embedded frames are
removed. The parent validates frame identity, null origin, nonce, and target id;
messages select a source but never save or execute commands. Ordinary file
selection previews deny external assets; artifact selection previews may load
assets from their configured artifact origin. Authenticated YA owns reads/writes.

## Rebuild after source save

Status: the hook registry, approval, bounded run, and preview swap landed
2026-09-23; reading-position restoration below remains design. The PII paper
builder emits the existing `ya-artifact:v1` discovery convention:

```html
<!-- ya-artifact:v1 {"regenerate":{"hook":"pii-paper-canvas","registrationVersion":1,"proposedRegistration":{"cwd":"/absolute/project","argv":["/absolute/python3","/absolute/project/scripts/pii_paper_canvas.py","--quarto","/absolute/quarto"],"outputs":["/absolute/paper/_build/paper-canvas.html","/absolute/paper/_build/paper-canvas.pdf","/absolute/paper/_build/paper-canvas.receipt.json","/absolute/paper/_build/paper-canvas.html.map"],"timeoutSeconds":180}}} -->
```

Paths are host-specific. `argv` is an argument vector, never shell code; `cwd`
anchors relative dependencies. `proposedRegistration` supplies a candidate for
the approved project-scoped hook registration described in the
[round-trip sketch](../gaps/sketches/source-mapped-artifact-editing.md#optional-round-trip-through-a-registered-regeneration-hook).
Discovery alone does not authorize execution. The paper's `--no-source-map`
mode retains this descriptor, includes the flag in `argv`, omits the map output,
and removes its previous sidecar. The default build includes mapping.

**Implemented behavior.** The preview read (`GET /api/file-edit?preview=1`)
parses the first `ya-artifact:v1` comment of an HTML artifact and returns a
`regenerate` status: the descriptor plus whether an approved registration
exists for this artifact path and hook, and whether it still matches the
proposal. Registrations live in app data
(`{dataDir}/artifact-rebuild/rebuild-hooks.json`), keyed by canonical
artifact path and hook id, never inside the project. A registry file that
cannot be read or parsed is renamed to
`rebuild-hooks.unreadable-<time>.json` beside it and logged, and the server
continues with no approvals, so every hook asks to be approved again rather
than the preview failing. The editor shows
**Rebuild** for an approved hook, or **Approve and rebuild…** otherwise, which
displays the working directory and argument vector and, on confirmation, sends
`register: true` with the run together with `approved`, the exact proposal and
`registrationVersion` it displayed. The server registers only when `approved`
equals the proposal it reads from the artifact at request time; a descriptor
rewritten after the preview (by an agent, or by the builder itself) is refused
with 409 and the current status, registers nothing, and runs nothing, and the
editor re-reads the status so the next approval shows the new command. A
`register: true` without `approved` is refused the same way. `POST
/api/file-edit/rebuild` likewise refuses an unapproved or changed proposal with
409 and the current status; it never re-approves implicitly. Only the
superuser may approve or run a hook: the route
itself answers 403 to any other principal before reading the artifact,
independently of the limited-user route table, because the command runs as the
host user outside any session sandbox. The server reads the artifact before a
run only to find its descriptor and keeps no copy of it while the command
runs. The run spawns the registered argv directly (no
shell) in the registered directory with the registered timeout and keeps a
64 KiB log tail. Its environment is the server's without YA's control-plane
credentials ([subprocess environment](subprocess-environment.md)). The command leads its own process group, so on expiry
SIGTERM and then, five seconds later, SIGKILL reach every process it started
(a producer's compilers, `pandoc`, LaTeX) as well as the command; on Windows
the whole tree is force-terminated at expiry. A process that left that tree
by starting its own group is not stopped, but the run still ends five seconds
after SIGKILL even if such a process holds the output open, reported as
timed out. Concurrent requests for one
artifact and hook join the in-flight run. On success the response carries the
re-read HTML, which the editor swaps in together with its recomputed target
list and clears the stale label; on failure the saved source and the old
preview stay, the notice reports the exit code or timeout, and **Build
output** expands the log. **Rebuild automatically after save** is a per-browser,
per-artifact opt-in shown only for an approved hook; a failed or conflicting
save never launches a build. The paper builder writes outputs directly; YA
does not yet snapshot the last successful revision before execution, so a
failed build can leave partially written outputs on disk.

Capture reading position before replacing the old preview. A first delivery
may restore the normalized scroll fraction `scrollTop / (scrollHeight -
clientHeight)` (zero for a non-scrollable page), clamped to the new extent.
Restore after fonts and images settle, and cancel pending restoration if the
reader scrolls or navigates meanwhile.

For better stability, retain the old verified map, the source target nearest
the viewport top, its viewport pixel offset, heading id, and an unchanged text
prefix. Use the save's actual replaced source range to translate that anchor:
positions before the edit stay unchanged; positions after it shift with the
edit; an overlapping anchor uses the edited item's start or nearest unchanged
preceding target. Match the new map by source path and translated range, then
restore the pixel offset. Do not rely only on target ids: the paper's paragraph
ids include line numbers and can change after earlier insertions. Prefer a
surviving heading or unchanged prefix when exact matching fails, then fall
back to scroll fraction. For figure edits retain the enclosing manuscript
anchor too. No-map builds use heading/fraction fallback. Reject stale map
hashes and older build completions instead of guessing a source location.

## Open implementation work

- [Rebuild output snapshot, reading position, and cancellation](../gaps/artifact-source-edit-rebuild.md).
- [Source-map positions become stale](../gaps/artifact-source-map-staleness.md).
- [Further text editing and optional session notice](../gaps/sketches/direct-text-edit-in-viewer.md).

Browser integration tests cover mapped selection, sequential typing with a
3,000-line source, disk saving, conflict preservation, direct HTML editing, and
older-server gating. Filesystem tests cover bounds, UTF-8, allow-set escapes,
pending writers, and mode preservation. Cross-platform validation is still
needed beyond Linux; WebKit is not installed on the validation host.
