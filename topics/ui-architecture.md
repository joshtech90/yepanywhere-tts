# UI Architecture

See also: [`injected-message-visibility.md`](injected-message-visibility.md) —
how YA-injected, non-user text (compaction commands, summaries, skill/resume
init text) is hidden or given the system/boundary contract instead of rendering
as a normal turn.

## Render Boundary Principle

When two views present the same model data, prefer to share the component,
renderer, or source adapter that creates the UI state. Do not satisfy a view
request by adding a custom click interceptor that inspects already-rendered DOM
and rewrites destinations as a primary design; that creates view-specific
spaghetti and prevents other views of the same data from inheriting the fix.

Preferred order:

1. Amend the data/model/render generator so the current UI state is produced in
   the right shape for all callers that should share the behavior.
2. Add an explicit view-bound adapter near the origin when only one context
   should differ, such as public-share snapshot/live file links.
3. Add a default-preserving parameter when other callers need the old behavior.
4. Use post-render rewriting only as a small containment bridge, with the rule
   named and scoped so it cannot silently become the architecture.

## Narrowing/Widening Stability Principle

Any UI surface that sheds items as space narrows and restores them as space
widens must behave with a fixed order in both directions: widening brings
items back in exactly the reverse order narrowing removed them, and the same
width always yields the same set. Two acceptable constructions:

1. **Provably fixed-order algorithm** (preferred — simpler): the shed/restore
   decision is a deterministic, monotone function of available space over a
   fixed removal order, so reverse-order restore holds by construction and no
   history is needed.
2. **Tracked removal order**: record the actual order items were removed
   (fine to compute in advance, e.g. width cutoffs) and replay it in reverse
   on widen.

What this bans: unordered recomputation — e.g. bin-packing by measured item
widths, or iteration-order-dependent selection — where widening can restore a
different set or sequence than narrowing removed, or where a boundary width
oscillates. Near-equality thresholds also need slack/hysteresis so measured
feedback (an item returning changes the measurement) cannot latch or
flip-flop; see the compact-signal traps in
[`composer-bottom-bar-overflow.md`](composer-bottom-bar-overflow.md).

Worked instance: the composer bottom-bar overflow engine
(`useMeasuredComposerOverflow` in `MessageInputToolbar.tsx`) walks a fixed
tier ladder (`none → early → medium → late`) one step at a time while
measured demand exceeds available width, and on any >1px widening resets to
`none` and re-escalates from scratch. The result at a given (layout, width)
is history-free and identical from either direction, so restore is
reverse-of-removal by construction — form 1 above.

## Public Share Example

Public shares have a valid reason for an independent unauthenticated top-level
page: the route is a read-only bearer-link trust boundary. That does not justify
forking the normal session/file presentation stack. The public route should feed
share-scoped loaders and link transforms into shared viewers, transcript rows,
media affordances, copy UI, spacing, and inspection behavior whenever those
affordances remain read-only.

Dynamic-scope or explicit snapshot/live link adaptation is acceptable for public
shares when the adaptation is attached to the shared rendering context or file
viewer source. It is not a license for arbitrary `onclick` URL surgery after
the UI has already been generated.

## Settings Pane Conventions

Settings panes apply changes immediately on interaction — the house style
for toggles, sliders, and selects (Notifications, Model, Appearance,
Development). A deferred Save/`hasChanges` flow is acceptable only for
free-text panes where partial input should not hit the server (Agent
Context, Lifecycle Webhooks, Providers, Local Access); continuous controls
like sliders debounce their saves rather than deferring them.

The per-pane undo affordance has a single implementation and a single
location: panes register their open-time snapshot revert via
`useSettingsUndo` / `useSettingsUndoBaseline`
(`pages/settings/SettingsUndoContext.tsx`), and `SettingsLayout` renders
the one Undo button top-right on the header row — never inside scrollable
pane content. A pane that adopts immediate apply should register undo so
accidental changes stay recoverable.

Undo semantics vary by pane kind, deliberately:
- **Snapshot panes** (immediate-apply or simple Save forms) revert to the
  pane-open snapshot via `useSettingsUndoBaseline` — wired in Message
  Delivery, Speech, Notifications, Development, Model, Emulator,
  Appearance, Agent Context, Lifecycle Webhooks, Remote Executors
  (list reconciliation; re-added hosts may lose position).
- **Apply-flow panes** (Local Access) register `useSettingsUndo` with
  discard-unapplied-edits semantics only: re-applying an old network
  binding automatically could sever the operator's own connection, so
  applying stays behind the explicit button.
- **Not wired**: About/Devices/Remote Access (status and actions, no
  undoable settings); Providers (below).

### Why Providers sub-form undo is deferred (likely never)

The Providers pane is several independent sub-forms (Ollama endpoint/prompt,
per-provider toggles, and any future helper-targets editor with edit-in-place
drafts), each with its own draft, validation, and Save lifecycle. The
header contract is one Undo button in one location, which forces a
single answer to "undo what?" — and across heterogeneous sub-forms
there is no honest single answer: reverting *all* sub-forms punishes a
user who finished one edit and is mid-draft in another; reverting only
the last-touched form makes the button's scope invisible. Supporting
this would mean either multi-registration plumbing (several buttons or
a scoped menu — breaking the one-button contract) or lifting every
sub-form's state into the pane (a refactor whose cost exceeds the
benefit: these are low-churn forms that already have explicit
Save/cancel lifecycles). Per the options-pay-rent principle in
[vanilla-defaults](vanilla-defaults.md), the affordance is not worth
its complexity here unless the pane is restructured for other reasons;
treat this as likely-never rather than pending.
