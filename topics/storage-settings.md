Topic: project-directory-storage

Status: implemented in current source after `0.7.0`. The two permanent
capabilities declare `0.7.1` as their first complete release.

Parent contracts:
[Project Directory Storage](project-directory-storage.md) and
[Session Media Handles](session-media-handles.md).

## Placement And Scope

Settings exposes a first-class **Storage** category immediately after
**Source Control**. A dedicated category is justified even with only two
controls because both are server-wide trust and retention decisions, neither
fits an existing category honestly, and older-server compatibility must remain
visible. **Performance** would misstate filesystem consent as tuning;
**Source Control** would omit attachments and media; **Local Access** and
**Environment** own different server concerns.

The page introduction is conceptually:

> Control where this YA server stores attachments and viewer state and whether
> it keeps independent copies of new tool-result images. This does not restrict
> files modified by agents or explicit source-control actions.

Both controls are server-persisted and apply to every project and client using
the connected YA server. V1 has no browser-local value, per-project override,
or custom path. `YEP_DATA_DIR` remains the way to choose the YA data directory.

The Settings search index includes the category, both choices, and terms such
as `YEP_DATA_DIR`, project folder, `.yep`, `.attachments`, tool result, image,
preserve, and storage.

## YA-Managed Project Data

The first section presents a full-width stacked radio list rather than a toggle
so the off state cannot be mistaken for disabling required attachment storage.
Each clickable option row carries its own explanation; the layout remains one
column as options are added instead of separating explanations from controls or
crowding choices into a fixed grid.

The section explicitly identifies the affected storage families: uploaded
attachments, Source Review drafts and exact file snapshots, Git author colors
used by blame, and tool-result images only when separate preservation is
enabled. “File snapshots” means the exact source bytes retained for a review
anchor, not assistant-turn or tool-output images. The section also
distinguishes that YA-owned state from files changed by agents or explicit
source-control actions.

### YA data directory — default

Store uploaded attachments, source-review state and captures, Git author color
assignments, and any separately enabled preserved media below the server's
configured YA data directory. Do not create YA storage paths, Git exclusions,
or YA-owned refs and objects inside projects.

This UI choice maps to:

```ts
settings.projectDirectoryStorage = "app-data";
```

### Inside each project — explicit opt-in

Allow eligible YA-managed state below the project-local `.yep/` root. YA may
best-effort add `.yep/` to that clone's local Git exclude after containment,
symlink, and tracked-path checks. Source-review capture may additionally write
YA-owned Git objects and `refs/yep/source-review/captures` because those
snapshots must remain addressable after the reviewed worktree changes.

This UI choice maps to:

```ts
settings.projectDirectoryStorage = "project";
```

New project-local attachment writes use
`<project>/.yep/attachments/<session-id>/`; they do not create or grow a
top-level `.attachments/` directory. Existing `.attachments/` data remains a
read-only compatibility source.

Selecting **Inside each project** chooses a permitted physical location. It
does not enable tool-result preservation, source-review submission history, or
any other independently default-off retention feature.

## Tool-Result Images

The second section presents a separate stacked radio list with the same
option-owned explanation pattern. There is no server disk cache mode in the
first implementation: the current persistent blob store has no eviction
behavior, and avoiding a provider-transcript rescan or repeated base64 decode
does not yet justify another setting. A measured future cache is a separate
policy and capability.

### Load on demand — default

Return authenticated lazy media handles without keeping an additional
persistent YA copy. Historical inline media is removed from the session
payload and retained only in a size- and lifetime-bounded process-memory
catalog; the browser fetches the bytes only when the image is viewed. A
path-only result remains available only while its permitted source exists.

This UI choice maps to:

```ts
settings.toolResultMediaPreservation = "on-demand";
```

Loading session details, expanding an image, listing or searching sessions,
starting the server, and listing, adding, opening, or indexing projects create
no persistent tool-result media copy in this mode.

### Preserve new tool-result images — explicit opt-in

Keep independent copies of eligible image results newly emitted while YA is
managing a session. Capture happens at the live tool-result boundary even when
no client tab is open, because a temporary source may disappear before the
next page view.

This UI choice maps to:

```ts
settings.toolResultMediaPreservation = "preserve";
```

The exact timing contract is:

- the setting takes effect for new tool results observed after the update;
- provider replay and persisted history are not new tool results;
- enabling it starts no background scan, import, migration, or backfill;
- loading or paginating historical session details never creates preserved
  copies;
- disabling it stops subsequent captures without deleting existing copies;
  and
- preserved copies are never pruned automatically and may grow without bound.

An implementation must distinguish genuinely new live output from provider
replay when a managed session starts or resumes. If that distinction is not
available at a provider boundary, that provider cannot claim preservation
support by treating replay as new output.

Preservation follows the location choice above:

- **YA data directory:** a project/session namespace below `YEP_DATA_DIR`;
- **Inside each project:**
  `<project>/.yep/tool-results/<session-id>/`.

The UI states the resolved class of destination and warns plainly:

> YA keeps adding preserved tool-result images until preservation is disabled.
> Preserved copies are not removed automatically.

Failure to preserve an optional copy must not interrupt the provider turn,
delete an older copy, or silently place the bytes in another location. The
bounded transient handle remains usable when preservation fails.

## Changes, Mixed Locations, And Legacy Data

The media-preservation setting affects future captures only; changing it does
not move, merge, copy, rehash, delete, repair, or backfill existing data. The
storage-location setting routes new additive data, but a mode change also
reconciles authoritative mutable Source Review state before it publishes the
new mode. Source Review drafts carry a durable logical revision; the highest
valid revision wins across roots, and equal-revision byte divergence blocks the
change. Active review operations drain before that state is copied and verified
at the destination. A failed transition leaves the old mode selected and may be
retried from its durable intent journal.

Immutable and additive storage families remain a validated union across roots.
Existing Source Review submission manifests stay pinned to their original
physical directory so the provider and response observer use the same path
across a mode change. Other existing attachments, preserved media, captures,
and project metadata are not migrated or deleted by the setting. A server may
therefore read a mixture of central data, opted-in `.yep` data, legacy
`.attachments`, and legacy unconditional `.yep/tool-results` data.

Read compatibility is not authorization to refresh or grow a legacy root. The
first implementation includes no bulk payload migration, historical-media
import, or cleanup workflow. Any later operation with those effects is
separate, explicit product work with its own preview and compatibility
contract.

When either stored setting is absent, including after upgrade, it resolves to
its default value: `"app-data"` and `"on-demand"`. Existing files remain in
place and readable where safe.

## Capability Advertisement

The controls are gated independently so later storage features do not broaden
an older advertised promise.

### `project-directory-storage-policy`

This permanent capability owns `GET /api/settings`, `PUT /api/settings`, and
`settings.projectDirectoryStorage: "app-data" | "project"`. Advertisement
attests that the complete audited YA-managed project/Git writer set obeys the
setting, absent configuration defaults to `"app-data"`, and revisioned mutable
Source Review state is reconciled before a mode change is published.

Without it, the client omits the field and shows the location control as
read-only with an update-required explanation. It does not claim the project
is protected because older stable servers may still write uploads into
`.attachments/`.

### `tool-result-media-preservation-policy`

This permanent capability owns `GET /api/settings`, `PUT /api/settings`, and
`settings.toolResultMediaPreservation: "on-demand" | "preserve"`.
Advertisement attests to all of the following:

- absent configuration defaults to `"on-demand"`;
- on-demand handles make no persistent media copy;
- historical session-detail reads never preserve media;
- preserve mode captures only new results from managed sessions; and
- preserved copies have no automatic expiry, size eviction, or pruning.

Without it, the client omits the field and shows the media control as
read-only with an update-required explanation. An unadvertised current-source
server may contain the earlier unconditional materializer, so the client must
not infer on-demand behavior merely because no stable release shipped that
implementation.

Each capability's registry `introducedIn` value is the first stable release
that implements its complete invariant. No stable release through `0.7.0`
advertised either capability. The maintainer explicitly accepted including
revision-safe storage transitions in `project-directory-storage-policy` for the
first stable release despite post-`0.7.0` source builds that briefly advertised
routing-only semantics. A later cache, historical import, cleanup, retention
limit, custom location, or per-project override requires a separately reviewed
contract and, when remotely observable, its own exact capability rather than
expansion of either promise above.

## Acceptance

The Settings implementation verifies:

- both defaults on a fresh and upgraded server with absent fields;
- server-wide persistence after destination preflight and reconciliation;
- repeated storage toggles retain the highest logical Source Review revision;
- equal-revision Source Review divergence and unsafe destinations leave the old
  mode selected;
- active review writes drain before destination verification and publication;
- independent gating, saving, loading, search, and undo behavior;
- read-only missing-capability explanations without unsupported requests;
- no project/Git mutation in app-data mode;
- no durable media write from live or historical sessions in on-demand mode;
- preserve-mode capture for new managed-session results with no open client;
- no preserve-mode capture from replay or historical detail requests;
- immutable submission paths remain pinned across mode changes;
- no bulk payload migration, cleanup, or deletion during destination changes;
  and
- legacy `.attachments` and `.yep/tool-results` reads without growth.
