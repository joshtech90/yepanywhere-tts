Topic: provider-sign-in

## Surfaces

`/provider-sign-in/claude` and `/provider-sign-in/codex` are focused setup
pages shared by local/desktop YA and remote YA (beneath its host base path).
They show only the chosen provider and its owner sign-in, with the host identity
in the header. Navigating the URL does not start or replace a CLI login; the
visible Sign in button does. Existing `supportsInAppLogin` flags gate the flow
on older servers; an unavailable host shows a setup explanation. Provider settings
also place links to these pages before the advanced controls. The experimental
Android host's native Set up buttons open these same pages.

Starting and polling failures remain visible beside the controls, with an
immediate pending label while a start request is outstanding. Sanitized CLI
output remains visible while the flow runs as well as on failure. A failure
must not require noticing a transient toast or guessing that a tap registered.
This is a structured official-CLI flow, not an interactive PTY terminal.

When Claude or Codex is installed but not authenticated, its Providers card
shows three equivalent routes to the same provider-owned login:

- **Copy login command.** `loginCommand` names the runtime YA actually
  resolved, which on Windows and in the desktop app is often not on `PATH`.
  On Windows a path that needs no quoting is emitted bare, so the command runs
  unchanged in both cmd.exe and PowerShell; a path that needs quoting uses
  PowerShell's `& "…"` call form. `formatExecutableInvocation` owns that rule.
- **Sign in** runs the login on the server without a terminal and relays it.
- **Open in a terminal on the server** opens a visible console on the
  server's own desktop running the interactive login. It is offered only where
  the server can open one: Windows (a new `cmd /k` console that stays open
  after the CLI exits) and macOS (Terminal through `osascript`). Other hosts
  omit the button.

The server reports `supportsInAppLogin` and `supportsHostTerminalLogin` per
provider in the provider catalog. Older servers omit both, and the client
shows only the copy panel. No global capability is allocated: the provider
payload itself carries the gate.

## Relayed sign-in

The relayed sign-in uses the same executable and environment the provider's
sessions use (Codex: its configured path and `CODEX_HOME`):

- Codex runs `codex login --device-auth`. YA shows the device page link and
  the one-time code; the CLI completes on its own once the user approves in
  any browser. The default browser login is not used because its callback is
  on the server's localhost.
- Claude runs `claude auth login --claudeai`. Without a terminal it prints an
  authorization link whose page displays a code; YA shows the link and a code
  field, and writes the submitted code to the CLI's stdin.

`/api/providers/:name/login` exposes the flow: `POST` starts one, `GET` reads
the current or recently finished one, `POST …/login/code` submits a code, and
`DELETE ?flowId=` cancels. `POST …/login/terminal` opens the host terminal.
Flow output is shown with terminal control sequences removed.

At most one flow runs per provider; starting another cancels the first. Every
flow ends within 15 minutes, matching the Codex code lifetime, and its CLI
process tree is terminated on cancel, expiry, or replacement. A finished flow
stays readable for five minutes so a polling client sees how it ended. The
client polls only while a flow is running and stops when the panel unmounts.
A client that opens the panel while a flow is running, including after a
layout change or from another device, resumes that flow. Success refreshes
the provider catalog so the card reflects the new authentication state.

## Authorization

Sign-in signs the host's CLI into an account, so it is owner-only. Limited
users are refused every `/api/providers/:name/login` route, including the
status read, because a live device code would sign the host into whichever
account enters it.
