Topic: provider-host-api

Status: stable same-user discovery, foreground headless bootstrap,
attach-or-start recovery, bounded auxiliary session turns, detached
submission observation, recent orderly-restart recovery, explicit
provider-session generation options, and an authenticated Hono adapter are
implemented on Linux. The non-watch development wrapper attaches to a
compatible incumbent host or starts one, and Codex uses the shared provider
host rather than a separate native host. Public feature copy labels this
source-checkout surface experimental and points back to this exact availability
and fallback contract.

## Why this is a YA layer

The provider worker is useful without a web UI. It owns the complete live
provider relationship: adapter, SDK query or protocol client, provider child,
message queue, approvals, controls, current-turn state, and sequenced output.
Hono currently projects that owner into a YA `Process`; a local agent tool can
instead submit one bounded turn and observe its result without acquiring the
full UI/server controller role.

This is provider-neutral control, not an alternate transcript format or a raw
stdin escape. Provider adapters retain their native responsibilities and YA's
normalized `SDKMessage` remains the shared event vocabulary.

## Observed pressure for a first-class control surface

On 2026-08-12 a working agent converted a YA session URL into direct REST
control without operating the JavaScript UI. Its first message POST omitted
`X-Yep-Anywhere: true` and failed before delivery with `Missing required
header`. The agent searched the installed YA distribution for that error,
resent the unchanged packet with the header, then polled the session process
route until completion. No duplicate provider turn began.

That trace disproved the expectation that agents would be unlikely to infer
and use YA's internal HTTP surface. It also exposed the wrong abstraction for
same-host tools: the custom header is a browser/HTTP boundary, while the
provider host already owns the reusable session queue and event stream. The
local control API makes that owner intentionally reachable; the Hono adapter
remains useful for authenticated remote callers.

## Current topology and protocols

On Linux, `pnpm provider-host` starts
`scripts/provider-runtime-host.mjs` in the foreground without Hono or Vite.
The host publishes `host.json`, `token`, `host.lock`, and `control.sock` under
`$YEP_PROVIDER_HOST_RUNTIME_DIR`, then `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, with a private
per-user temporary-runtime fallback. The directory is mode 0700 and the
descriptor, token, and socket are mode 0600. The descriptor records owner and
worker process identities plus source/build identity without exposing the
token value.

The Linux non-watch `scripts/dev.js` path probes that descriptor before
starting Hono. It attaches to a compatible host, starts one when absent, or
performs verified bounded recovery when an identified host is nonresponsive.
Hono receives the discovered endpoint and token through private environment
state. A host started by the wrapper retains wrapper IPC as its terminal-owner
channel; a separately started foreground host retains its terminal instead.

Compatibility includes exact launch source, not only protocol version. The
descriptor binds the canonical checkout root and a content digest over the dev
launcher, host, worker, every statically reachable project-source dependency,
and the manifests/lockfile that resolve those imports. Both launchers compute
the same expected identity before discovery. A different checkout, changed
import, changed dependency resolution, or build identity is incompatible and
cannot be authenticated, registered, or attached as the current host.

Host protocol version 3 is newline-delimited JSON over the control socket.
Every request carries a request id, token, Hono generation, and protocol
version. The implemented operations are:

- `status` and `registerServer`;
- `launch`, `launchOrClaim`, `bind`, `list`/`inventory`, `claim`, and
  `confirmAttach`;
- streamed `sessionTurn` and `awaitSessionTurn`, plus `sessionTurnStatus` and
  `interruptSessionTurn`;
- `setViewerPresence`, `release`, and `terminate`; and
- `retainProcessGroup` for host-owned auxiliary provider resources.

The host permits one registered Hono controller generation per worker. It
fences stale/concurrent controllers and keeps a canonical provider-session-id
to worker mapping until verified cleanup.

Each worker opens a separate private Unix socket using worker protocol version
1. Hono attaches with the same private token and its registered generation.
The stream carries queue pushes, queue-depth/removal state, sequenced
`SDKMessage` events and acknowledgements, provider controls/RPC, permission
state, approvals, completion, and failure. Acknowledgement advances only after
the Hono `Process` consumes an event, so reload replay can repeat a boundary but
cannot silently discard an unacknowledged suffix.

These are real local listeners rather than anonymous provider pipes. Stable
discovery remains same-user local: the token stays in an owner-only file, the
host never binds TCP, worker sockets remain undiscoverable private endpoints,
and auxiliary callers reach workers only through the host's bounded turn
operation.

## Same-session and fork contract

Submitting through a hosted worker uses that worker's existing `MessageQueue`
and provider connection. It never invokes a second provider resume. This is the
mechanism that avoids Claude different-parent branches for hosted interaction;
watching transcript JSONL only establishes receipt.

YA's existing Hono message route has the same relevant safety property for a
live session: it requires an existing `Process`, enters its queue, and returns
`No active process for session` rather than starting a second resume. Provider
hosting and the route are separate ownership layers.

Native Claude resume does not fork merely because it is a resume. Concurrent
interactions against one provider session can create different-parent
branches. A future caller may deliberately accept that risk when no host is
available; the host protocol itself never manufactures that fallback.

## Reachable local protocol

The stable local surface extends the host control socket rather than exposing
worker sockets or raw provider-child stdin. A client first authenticates to the
host descriptor, negotiates a protocol version, then issues one streamed
`sessionTurn` operation. The initial version has this conceptual request shape:

```json
{
  "id": "request-correlation-id",
  "submissionId": "client-generated-retry-id",
  "op": "sessionTurn",
  "protocolVersion": 3,
  "token": "local-capability",
  "target": {
    "harness": "claude",
    "providerSessionId": "durable-provider-id",
    "yaSessionId": "optional-canonical-ya-id"
  },
  "message": { "text": "one user turn" },
  "sessionOptions": {
    "automaticTitle": false,
    "automaticRecaps": false,
    "agentProgressSummaries": false,
    "promptSuggestions": false
  }
}
```

The stream flushes records as they occur:

```json
{"id":"...","type":"accepted","runtimeId":"...","submissionId":"...","cursor":1,"sessionOptionsResult":{}}
{"id":"...","type":"providerEvent","sequence":42,"message":{},"cursor":2}
{"id":"...","type":"terminal","outcome":"completed","receipt":{},"cursor":3}
```

Additive fields remain backward-compatible within the negotiated version. The
implemented meanings are:

- `accepted` means the worker queue durably accepted the identified
  submission; a caller must not fall back to another transport afterward;
- `sessionOptionsResult` reports each requested provider-owned generation
  option as `applied`, `inactive`, `restart-required`, `unsupported`, or
  `unknown`; an omitted request is normalized to all four options being off;
- `providerEvent` is an ordered observation scoped to this turn, normally a
  normalized `SDKMessage`, with an optional provider-native record;
- `terminal` distinguishes completed, provider-failed, interrupted,
  uncertain-after-acceptance, and host-recovery outcomes and includes the best
  provider-transcript watermark/receipt available;
- `cursor` is the count of retained records through that record, not a
  provider event sequence number; and
- a disconnect before `accepted` is safe to retry, while a disconnect after it
  requires receipt lookup rather than automatic duplicate submission.

One `sessionTurn` submission represents exactly one logical provider turn. It
may carry many provider events, tool cycles, status records, or compaction
boundaries, but it has one terminal record. Records after terminal are a
protocol defect or belong to another independently submitted turn.

The caller-generated `submissionId` is the retry identity. Reusing it with the
same target, message, session options, and launch request replays the current
host's retained records; reusing it with different content returns
`submission-id-conflict`. `awaitSessionTurn` observes only that submission and
takes an optional non-negative `afterCursor`, with omission meaning record
zero. A live in-memory submission replays records after that cursor and follows
new records through terminal. If only the durable terminal receipt remains,
the operation returns one `receipt-only` terminal record with a null cursor;
discarded provider events cannot be reconstructed. An unknown submission or a
cursor beyond the retained record count fails explicitly. Observer disconnect
does not cancel the accepted turn.

The host retains up to 1,000 submissions and receipt rows for 24 hours.
`sessionTurnStatus` remains the point-in-time receipt query; it is not a stream
or terminal wait.

Acceptance has a 15-second deadline. The default whole-turn deadline is 30
minutes and callers may request between one second and two hours. Provider
output is bounded at 10,000 records or 64 MiB; crossing either limit requests
interruption and terminates the observable result as
`uncertain-after-acceptance`. Socket backpressure pauses writes to that
listener while records remain bounded in the submission ledger. Disconnecting
a listener never cancels an accepted turn; `interruptSessionTurn` is the
explicit cancellation operation.

An auxiliary submission is accepted only while the incumbent worker is alive,
idle, has an exactly observable queue-yield boundary, and has no pending
approval. Before queue acceptance, the worker asks the adapter to apply or
evaluate the requested session options. A failed option request rejects the
turn before acceptance; an unavailable control returns an explicit bounded
result rather than claiming enforcement. While the turn is active, Hono may
remain the approval controller but cannot queue or steer another provider
turn. Without an attached Hono controller, a new provider approval is
reported, denied, and terminates the auxiliary result as
`provider-approval-required`. The auxiliary stream observes provider events but
never acknowledges Hono's replay buffer.

Provider-owned generation is a provider/session boundary, separate from YA's
rendering and helper policies. The four current controls are automatic session
titles, provider-native recap turns, periodic subagent progress summaries, and
predicted prompt suggestions. Every omitted value resolves to false. An
adapter may expose `setSessionOptions` for an incumbent session, but it must
report launch-only changes as `restart-required`, unavailable opt-ins as
`unsupported`, intrinsically absent disabled features as `inactive`, and an
unverified provider surface as `unknown`.

Local `launchOrClaim` and the optional `sessionTurn.launch` object may resume a
matching provider worker when no incumbent exists. The requested harness must
match the provider adapter, and worker startup must report the exact requested
durable provider id. The HTTP adapter deliberately has no launch authority. An
auxiliary-launched worker returns to a 30-second idle teardown deadline after
its turn; an uncertain accepted result reaps that worker immediately.

An orderly provider-host shutdown also snapshots the exact cloneable launch
recipe for each live, identified, claimable runtime before teardown and
publishes that set only after all owned worker/provider process groups have
stopped successfully. The mode-0600 record is bounded to 1 MiB and 1,000
candidates inside the mode-0700 runtime directory. A replacement host starting
within five minutes unlinks and validates the record before serving work, then
may lazily use one exact match when a local `sessionTurn` request opts into
`resumeRecentRuntime`. A supplied YA id remains an ownership cross-check. The
candidate is forgotten after a successful relaunch or when a live/new runtime
supersedes it. A stale, future, malformed, ambiguous, wrong-owner,
crash-surviving, or failed-cleanup record cannot launch a worker.

Recent-runtime recovery resumes the durable provider session for a later new
turn; it does not continue or resubmit a turn interrupted by host shutdown.
It is a negotiated private-socket feature. The Hono HTTP adapter reconstructs
its restricted request and still has neither launch nor recent-runtime
recovery authority.

The structured control outcomes include `unavailable`, `incompatible`,
`ownership-unknown`, `busy`, `timed-out-before-acceptance`,
`uncertain-after-acceptance`, `provider-approval-required`, and
`interrupted-by-host-recovery`. A verified nonresponsive-host replacement
rewrites every persisted accepted receipt to the recovery outcome before the
replacement starts.

Harness plus durable provider session id is the portable address. A supplied
YA session id is a stronger cross-check, not a replacement; disagreement is a
structured ownership error. The host may claim or launch only one worker for
the resolved provider session. An auxiliary turn client is a bounded
producer/observer and never becomes the Hono controller, answers unrelated
approvals, or acknowledges/reorders Hono's replay stream.

## Hybrid access

The Unix socket is the primary same-host API. Unix-domain transport avoids HTTP
parsing and network exposure, but latency is not the design reason: provider
inference and YA processing dominate either local transport. Filesystem
ownership, narrow capability scope, headless availability, and direct access to
the runtime owner are the reasons to keep it.

Authenticated Hono routes adapt remote and relayed clients to the same host:

- `GET /api/provider-host/status`;
- `GET /api/provider-host/runtimes`;
- `POST /api/provider-host/session-turn`, returning newline-delimited records;
- `GET /api/provider-host/session-turn/:submissionId`; and
- `POST /api/provider-host/session-turn/:submissionId/interrupt`.

The adapter applies YA's ordinary `/api/*` admission, authorization,
host/origin, and custom-header checks. It limits a request to 1 MiB, turn text
to 900 KiB, and the timeout to the host's one-second through two-hour range.
It has no provider-launch authority: a remote caller can address only an
incumbent worker. Provider-host failures before acceptance map to unavailable;
an adapter failure after acceptance is reported as uncertain rather than
inviting a second submission.

The permanent `provider-host-control` server capability uses id 30 and is
advertised only while the Hono generation is registered with the compatible
host. Clients that do not see it hide the control surface and make none of
these requests. This preserves the approved `v0.7.0` and `v0.6.2` fallback and
does not widen either retained Codex-native capability id.

The route is not required by the planned `~/agents` helper, which uses the
local socket and may choose its own native provider-resume fallback.

The provider host is never directly exposed on TCP. Worker endpoints stay
private even to local helper clients.

## Headless bootstrap and discovery

A foreground headless launcher starts the provider host without Vite or Hono.
It publishes one atomic descriptor in a stable same-user runtime directory:

- host protocol version and feature bits;
- control-socket path;
- token-file path, with token bytes kept out of logs and command arguments;
- owner PID and process-start identity; and
- source/build identity needed to decide whether provider code is current.

The directory is mode 0700 and descriptor, token, socket, durable receipt
store, and recent-runtime recovery record are no broader than mode 0600. The
launcher remains the terminal owner: SIGINT/SIGTERM and owner loss shut down
and verify every worker/provider descendant. Only verified orderly shutdown
may publish recent launch recipes; nonresponsive-host recovery removes any
such marker. A headless host with no workers has no per-session timers or
polling loops.

The Hono launcher uses attach-or-start:

1. Read the expected descriptor and complete a bounded authenticated `status`
   handshake.
2. Register with a live compatible host.
3. If no host exists, acquire a single-instance start right, start one host,
   publish the descriptor atomically, then register.
4. If the recorded host is nonresponsive, verify its PID/start identity,
   terminate the host and all known worker/provider process groups with bounded
   TERM-to-KILL escalation, verify absence, remove stale endpoint state, then
   start exactly one replacement.
5. If identity or cleanup cannot be proved, fail closed rather than unlinking a
   socket and creating a concurrent owner.

Replacing a nonresponsive host may interrupt active provider turns and reports
that outcome. Endpoint absence alone never authorizes killing an unverified
process.

## Reload, code adoption, configuration, and defaults

Safe Reload is a Hono-generation operation. It intentionally preserves shared
provider workers and therefore does not update provider code inside workers
that already exist. A new worker launched after reload uses current code; a
targeted worker relaunch updates one session; a full wrapper/host reboot
guarantees adoption across all hosted sessions. UI and operator documentation
must not equate `Server changed` or `Reload` with provider-runtime refresh.

Shared provider hosting is automatic when its launch capability is present. It
has no user-facing enable setting. Unsupported platforms, watch mode, direct
server launches without a host, failed capability probes, or explicit
provider-host disablement use ordinary in-Hono ownership; headless session
control then reports unavailable.

The `codexReloadSafeSessions` setting remains in the server schema and storage
for old-client compatibility, but is ignored for routing. New clients hide the
selector, and new servers do not advertise native-host availability. Its
capability ids remain reserved and their old meanings are not widened into this
provider-neutral API.

## Retirement compatibility

The latest two stable server releases are `v0.7.0` and `v0.6.2`; as of
2026-08-12 there is no additional stable release in the preceding 14 days.
Both predate the unreleased 0.7.1 capability ids for the Codex-native runtime
and setting.

The server preserves the settings field on reads and writes, the client hides
it, and native-host availability is no longer advertised. Older clients may
continue to send the inert field; no unsupported route or field is introduced
for them. The provider-host-control capability uses a new id and protocol
version, while the permanent capability ledger retains all prior assignments.

## Observable acceptance contract

- A local client can start the headless host, discover it, negotiate the
  protocol, and exchange a turn without Hono listening.
- Starting Hono attaches to the expected live host and does not create a second
  host. With no host it starts one; with a nonresponsive verified owner it
  performs bounded verified replacement.
- A host from another canonical checkout or with any changed launcher/host/
  worker dependency is reported incompatible before token use and is never
  attached as the current source generation.
- A hosted Claude turn uses the incumbent worker and creates no second resume
  process. Codex uses the same shared-host path after native-host retirement.
- Provider-owned title, recap, progress-summary, and prompt-suggestion
  generation is disabled when the caller omits session options. Acceptance
  reports enforcement per option instead of treating silence as success.
- An accepted submission is never automatically retried through another
  transport after a control connection fails.
- A caller may detach after `accepted`, then replay/follow that exact
  submission from a returned cursor through its single terminal record;
  observer disconnect or deadline expiry does not cancel the provider turn.
- A replacement host started within five minutes of verified orderly shutdown
  can lazily relaunch an opted-in exact target from the predecessor's private
  recipe. Crash recovery, ownership disagreement, and stale state fail closed.
- Hono reload preserves eligible active turns but does not claim that retained
  workers loaded changed provider code.
- A compatible retained local worker refreshes the replacement Hono
  generation's two allowlisted browser-debugging values for later Bash tool
  shells. The caller factor is domain-separated from the provider-host boot
  token and therefore remains valid across Hono replacement; the initial
  worker-code deployment still requires a wrapper restart.
- Full wrapper shutdown and nonresponsive-host replacement leave no host,
  worker, provider process group, socket, descriptor, or token artifact behind.
- Host absence degrades to ordinary in-Hono sessions; it never weakens network
  admission or makes the provider-host socket remotely reachable.

## Design decisions

- **Content-address the reachable provider-host source graph** (vs. hashing
  only entrypoints or the whole server tree): imported provider changes fence
  attachment while unrelated Hono-only edits retain Safe Reload. The canonical
  checkout root remains a separate fence so identical bytes in another clone
  cannot silently acquire an incumbent source checkout's host.

## Verification evidence

On 2026-08-12 an isolated non-watch wrapper started from the then-current
protocol-v2 source tree and registered its fresh Hono generation. A local
socket submission launched the deterministic Claude-labeled worker, emitted
accepted plus three ordered provider events, and completed with watermark 3. A
second submission through the authenticated Hono adapter reached the same
runtime id and completed with the same record sequence. The version route
advertised `provider-host-control` during registration. Terminal wrapper
shutdown closed the server, maintenance, and Vite ports; removed the
descriptor, token, lock, and control socket; and left no smoke descendant.

The protocol-v3 provider-session-options change has deterministic host/worker
coverage for default normalization, retry fingerprinting, adapter application
before acceptance, and per-option results. The upgraded `session-turn` helper
was also exercised twice against the live protocol-v2 YA/Codex incumbent: both
submissions stayed on the provider-host transport and completed, while the
transitional helper correctly reported option enforcement as `unknown` rather
than claiming an old host had applied it.

A fresh isolated protocol-v3 wrapper then exercised real Codex and Claude
sessions through `session-turn`. Both used the provider-host transport and
completed. Codex reported all four generators inactive. Claude reported title,
progress-summary, and prompt-suggestion controls applied and native recaps
inactive. The Claude session was launched with the `Native` prompt-suggestion
observation preference, but its transcript still began with YA's fixed title
and contained no `prompt_suggestion`; this verifies that the observation choice
does not opt into provider generation. Wrapper shutdown removed the isolated
host artifacts and left no listening smoke server or provider process.

This is end-to-end integration evidence for wrapper, host, worker queue,
adapter, receipt, and cleanup behavior. Provider-specific real-runtime smokes
remain release confidence for the other upstream adapters; the same-worker
queue and identity fencing are the non-forking mechanism rather than transcript
observation.
