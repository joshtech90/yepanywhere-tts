Topic: session-dom-linger-speedup

Status: First one-session underlay linger slice implemented 2026-07-01. The
current `SessionRouteSnapshot` implementation remains the fallback safety net,
not the final latency target. User-observed warm returns can take over
0.5 seconds when React remounts the transcript and deterministic renderers
rebuild DOM, so the implemented fast path keeps the already-mounted session DOM
alive for a bounded grace window.

## Problem

`client-route-retention` now restores session data and scroll state
synchronously, but React still remounts the transcript and deterministic
renderers still rebuild visible DOM. For short returns, especially
session -> Inbox/Agents/Source Control/Settings -> back, the old DOM was
available milliseconds ago. A fixed grace-period linger could make those
returns feel closer to switching browser tabs.

The committed snapshot path avoids the worst defect, a blocking data fetch and
full-page loader, but it cannot make large transcripts instant by itself. The
expensive work left on a warm return is client-side: route remount, render-item
reconstruction, markdown/tool renderer DOM creation, layout, and scroll
restoration. Keeping the DOM mounted is the direct fix for that remaining
latency.

## Proposal

Keep at most the most recent one or two session route DOM trees hidden for a
short same-tab grace period, initially 60 seconds. A return to the same source,
project, session id, and tail-window params during the grace period reattaches
or reveals the lingered tree immediately. Expiry, source switch, auth switch,
tab close, reload, memory pressure, or route mismatch destroys it.

This is deliberately narrower than generic route keep-alive. It is a speed
layer on top of explicit `SessionRouteSnapshot` retention, not a substitute for
the snapshot/delta path. When DOM linger misses, the normal retained snapshot
path still gives an immediate useful view without a blocking loader.

## Recommended First Slice

Implemented first slice: one-session **underlay linger**. When the user leaves
a session for a non-session route, keep the session route mounted in a hidden/inert
session layer underneath the foreground route. Source Control, Inbox, Agents,
Settings, and similar routes render in the foreground layer while the URL and
browser history behave normally. Returning by browser Back or by selecting the
same session removes the foreground layer and reveals the already-mounted
session layer.

This is likely faster and simpler than physically moving DOM nodes between
containers. The session subtree stays owned by the same React host, its scroll
container stays alive, and renderer state remains intact. The desired user
experience is closer to switching browser tabs than to remounting a route from
cached data.

Initial scope:

- one lingered session entry only
- session -> non-session route -> same session within 60 seconds
- direct session A -> session B navigation does not park A; it unmounts or
  expires the parked slot and relies on `SessionRouteSnapshot` if the user later
  returns
- same source, auth state, project id, YA session id, route params, and
  tail-window params only
- no cross-tab, reload, or durable persistence
- fallback to `SessionRouteSnapshot` on every miss or expiry

Do not expand this into a generic keep-alive wrapper for all routes. Session
detail is the latency problem and the resource-risk problem; solving it with a
narrow session host keeps the behavior inspectable.

Do not start with two parked sessions. A second parked transcript tree adds the
riskiest failure modes first: duplicate live streams, focus and shortcut
ambiguity, confusing ownership of scroll/composer-adjacent state, and mobile
memory spikes. If a later pass wants two entries, it needs separate memory and
resource evidence after the one-entry path is proven.

## Resource Contract

- Bounded grace: default candidate 60 seconds.
- Bounded entries: one session first; two only after memory testing.
- Same-tab only; no durable persistence and no cross-source reuse.
- Hidden DOM must not survive a closed tab or browser reload.
- The hidden route must be inert to the foreground route: no pointer events,
  no focus capture, no accessible duplicate transcript, and no foreground
  keyboard shortcut handling.
- The owner for every lingering stream, watch, retry timer, and poll must be
  explicit. Either suspend it while hidden or count it as an intentionally
  grace-bounded live client resource.
- A hidden session must not indefinitely warm provider context, hold server
  watchers, or schedule recurring catch-up work after the grace period.

## Implementation Shape

Introduce a small `SessionDomLingerHost` near route layout, keyed by source,
project, session id, route params, and query params. When leaving a session
route for a non-session route, park the route subtree in the host instead of
unmounting it. Prefer the underlay shape for the first pass:

```text
NavigationLayout
  SessionDomLingerHost
    parked SessionPage for the most recent matching session
  ActiveRouteOutlet
    SourceControl / Inbox / Agents / Settings / ...
```

While parked, the session layer should be hidden or covered in a way that keeps
component and scroll state alive. It should also be `inert`, `aria-hidden`, and
non-interactive so the foreground route owns focus, pointer events, and keyboard
handling. On a matching return before expiry, reveal the parked layer instead
of remounting `SessionPage`. On expiry or mismatch, unmount normally so existing
cleanup paths close streams, watches, timers, and polling hooks.

The implementation should record a clear linger state machine:

- `active`: session route is the visible route
- `parked`: matching session route is hidden behind a non-session foreground
  route
- `revealed`: browser Back or session reselection reused the parked route
- `expired`: timer/mismatch/source/auth change destroyed the parked route

The router contract matters: URL, browser history, active nav selection, and
foreground route data loading must continue to behave as if normal navigation
happened. DOM linger is an implementation detail of route rendering, not a
second navigation stack.

This first version is default-on because the user explicitly selected it as the
needed speed path and the one-entry/60-second caps make it bounded. Do not infer
from that that generic hidden keep-alive is generally safe.

## Content-Frame Contract

Built-in content viewers launched from session content must preserve the session
underlay. A normal click on a generated file-path link, `Read`/`Edit` file link,
local-file link, local-media link, or explicit YA project-file viewer URL should
open a modal or content-frame viewer while the current session remains mounted
underneath. Browser Back is an acceptable close gesture for those viewers: for
modals it should close the modal; for a full-frame content route it should leave
the viewer route and reveal the lingered session immediately.

Full-frame built-in viewers belong inside `NavigationLayout` as content-frame
routes, not as sibling routes that unmount the layout. They may cover 100% of
the app frame and suppress sidebar chrome, but the session linger host must stay
mounted. `/projects/:projectId/file` is the current concrete example.

External offsite links that navigate the browser away from YA are outside this
contract. If YA later adds a built-in offsite/web viewer, that viewer must follow
the same modal/content-frame rule: Back acts as close/return, the foreground
viewer owns focus and pointer events, and the parked session remains inert.

## New-Tab And Cross-Tab Model

New-tab navigation starts a fresh app instance from a URL. A modified or
middle-click on Settings, Source Control, Inbox, Agents, or another ordinary
React Router `Link` must stay browser-native: the source tab must not run the
same-tab route transition, so it must not park the current session merely
because the new tab opens. The new tab mounts its own `NavigationLayout` and
has no access to the source tab's hidden DOM or React state.

Browser tabs have separate DOM trees, JavaScript heaps, React component
instances, and per-tab singleton objects. Same-origin tabs can still share
browser storage and explicit communication channels such as `localStorage`
events, `BroadcastChannel`, a service worker, or a shared worker, but those
channels can only transfer structured data and messages. They cannot transfer a
live DOM tree, React fiber, scroll container, WebSocket object, or in-memory
hook state between tabs.

The current linger cap is therefore per tab, not global. Viewing the same YA
session in two tabs creates two live session-route instances when both tabs are
on the session URL. If either tab leaves to a non-session route, that tab may
park its own copy for the 60-second grace window. For an active process, each
mounted session route can also create its own session subscription and prompt
cache keepalive viewer lease; the server cleans each lease on unsubscribe, but
there is no current cross-tab election that collapses duplicate same-session
viewers into one owner.

If duplicate same-session tabs become a measured resource problem, mitigation
should be coordination rather than DOM transfer:

- A same-origin tab registry can use `BroadcastChannel` plus a short
  `localStorage` lease, or `navigator.locks` where available, to elect one
  active owner for expensive per-session work while non-owners stay passive.
- A duplicate-session link could ask an already-open owner tab to focus itself
  only when browser restrictions allow it; arbitrary focus of unrelated tabs is
  not a dependable Chrome capability.
- A service worker or shared worker can centralize data fetching or message
  fan-out, but cannot share UI state or mounted DOM. That is a larger transport
  architecture change, not an extension of the DOM linger host.

Current stance: do not implement cross-tab coordination until duplicate
same-session tabs show a real resource or correctness cost. The current
one-entry linger cap is intentionally per tab, and duplicate tabs require the
user to open the same session in multiple browser contexts. That is not yet a
demonstrated priority.

Evidence that would justify revisiting this:

- debug traces showing multiple same-browser-profile tabs holding the same
  source/project/session subscription or prompt-cache keepalive lease for long
  enough to matter
- a measured server or browser symptom, such as duplicated high-volume live
  deltas, extra focused watches, excess keepalive refreshes, or visible CPU and
  memory pressure from duplicate mounted transcript trees
- a clear product decision for two visible windows on the same session: whether
  both must receive full live updates independently, or whether a follower tab
  may depend on an owner tab's broadcast stream with fast fallback

Lowest-risk sequence if that evidence appears:

1. Add instrumentation only. Count same-browser-profile duplicate session
   viewers and keepalive leases without changing behavior.
2. Add a same-origin presence registry keyed by source, project, session id,
   route params, and tail params. Use `BroadcastChannel` plus a short
   `localStorage` lease, or `navigator.locks` where available, and publish only
   compact state: tab id, route key, visibility, parked/active status, and last
   heartbeat.
3. Reduce work only for hidden or parked duplicates first. A visible foreground
   duplicate should keep its direct server subscription until the follower path
   has complete replay, ordering, and owner-loss handling.
4. If needed, trial an owner/follower subscription model. The owner holds the
   server session subscription and rebroadcasts structured events; followers
   fall back to their own subscription when the owner heartbeat expires, when
   ordering gaps appear, or when the browser lacks the chosen coordination API.

Do not use cross-tab coordination as a hidden focus-stealing feature. Focusing
an already-open duplicate tab is at best an opportunistic convenience when the
browser allows it, not a correctness primitive. Do not use a service worker or
shared worker as the first step; that changes the transport architecture and
still cannot share the session DOM.

## Verification

- Browser test: session -> non-session route -> back within 60 seconds reuses
  the lingered DOM, preserves scroll, and shows no loading or progressive
  render bar.
- Performance check: session -> Source Control -> Back should reveal the
  existing session within one animation frame on development hardware. If the
  route still takes hundreds of milliseconds, the implementation is falling
  back to remount or doing synchronous foreground work on reveal.
- Back/reselect parity: browser Back and sidebar/session-list reselection of
  the same session should hit the same linger-reveal path.
- Expiry test: after the grace period, the subtree unmounts and the normal
  retained snapshot path handles return.
- Resource test: hidden linger entries do not accumulate streams, session
  watches, poll timers, or reconnect loops beyond the cap and grace period.
- Memory smoke: visit several large sessions on a mobile-width viewport and
  confirm linger eviction plus session snapshot byte caps bound tab memory.

## 2026-07-01 Implementation Notes

`NavigationLayout` owns the linger layer. Session routes render through that
layout-owned layer; the React Router child route is only a marker. Non-session
routes continue through the normal `Outlet` as the foreground layer. Session
route identity is parsed from `location.pathname`, not inherited child
`useParams()`, because a parent layout can otherwise retain stale session params
after navigation to `/git-status`.

`SessionPage` accepts the saved session route location so a parked instance does
not start reading Source Control or Settings as its own route. While parked,
the session disables page-title ownership, engagement tracking, URL-sync
navigation effects, and transcript-level global interaction listeners. The
stream and render state stay alive until the 60-second expiry unmounts the
parked layer.

The inverse latency problem is tracked separately in
[`session-exit-navigation-latency.md`](session-exit-navigation-latency.md):
leaving a large session for Settings or another lightweight route should paint
the new foreground route immediately, even when DOM linger is disabled or when
the old session can be parked for fast Back/reselect.

Browser smoke against a 173-message Codex session verified:

- session -> Source Control parks the session layer while Source Control is
  foreground
- Back reveals the same `.message-list` DOM node
- after waiting for the original session render to settle, Back samples showed
  no full loader and no progressive render bar

If the user leaves before the initial progressive render has completed, DOM
linger preserves that existing in-progress overlay. That is expected for this
slice: the feature avoids remount work; it does not hide work that was already
visible before navigation away.

Follow-up verification added generated assistant text paths and explicit
project-file viewer URLs to the contract. Normal clicks on those links open the
same `FileViewerModal`; direct navigation to `/projects/:projectId/file` stays
inside `NavigationLayout` as a sidebarless content-frame route so Back can reveal
the parked session rather than remounting it.

2026-07-01 code inspection verified ordinary sidebar navigation still uses
React Router `Link`, whose click handler only intercepts unmodified left-clicks.
Modified clicks and middle-clicks are left to the browser, so opening Settings
or similar routes in a new tab does not trigger hidden-DOM parking in the source
session tab. The current app has cross-tab storage/channels for preferences,
draft decorations, service-worker messages, and shared speech mic leasing, but
no session-view ownership or DOM-transfer protocol.
