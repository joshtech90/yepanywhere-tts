Topic: glossary-tooltips

See also: [relay head-of-line blocking](../docs/project/relay-head-of-line-blocking.md).

Status: Implemented 2026-08-04. The shared grammar, resolver, capability-gated
delivery, tab-local cache,
annotation boundary, interaction, authenticated render surfaces, FileViewer
link convergence, and performance/visual acceptance are complete. Public
shares deliberately remain unannotated. Demand-driven source resolution landed
2026-08-04 and the observed-directory watches it implied landed 2026-08-05, so
nothing in this feature reaches past the directories resolution actually named.
External files opened in a session FileViewer gained that session's root
glossary graph on 2026-08-10. Plain user-turn text gained root-glossary hints
on 2026-08-16.

## Product contract

When the browser-local **Glossary hints** Appearance preference is enabled, YA
annotates glossary terms in eligible rendered prose. The preference is
default-off under
[vanilla-defaults](vanilla-defaults.md). This is one render-boundary feature,
not a file-preview special case. It covers:

- plain user-turn text, using the project-root glossary artifact;
- assistant Markdown and other project-affiliated Markdown documents;
- full and range-based Markdown file previews;
- Read and Write previews;
- Markdown-eligible Edit and diff views, including Source Control; and
- organically Markdown-rendered fixed-font output when it has project context.

A surface that stays in source/raw mode is unchanged. Existing gates that keep
code files and non-Markdown diffs out of structural Markdown rendering remain
authoritative; glossary matching does not make an otherwise ineligible surface
Markdown-renderable. User-turn text remains plain text rather than becoming a
Markdown surface. Confirmed file paths and URLs are established first, and the
glossary matcher annotates only the remaining plain segments, so it cannot split
or nest inside either anchor.

An eligible Markdown file opens as rendered Markdown, including when its link
targets a line or bounded range. Source remains an explicit viewer toggle;
glossary readiness never selects source mode or delays the initial rendered
content.

The presence of an in-scope `GLOSSARY.md` is the content-level prerequisite;
the browser preference is the user-level opt-in. Projects without one and
browsers with the preference disabled render exactly as before. YA does not
create, modify, or exclude a glossary or any other project-local file for this
feature.

## Which glossary controls a render

For a rendered source file, begin in that file's directory and walk parent
directories up to and including the selected project root. The first regular
file named exactly `GLOSSARY.md` is the single governing glossary for that
render. Parent and sibling glossaries do not participate merely because of
their placement; the governing glossary opts into their entries by referring
to them.

Project-affiliated prose without a source-file path uses the project-root
`GLOSSARY.md`. A selected Source Control file resolves from its displayed
target path. A file outside the selected project but opened from an
authenticated session has no meaningful nested project scope, so it uses that
session project's root glossary and explicit include graph as project-
affiliated prose. A `GLOSSARY.md` never annotates itself.

Any project-local path mentioned in a parsed `GLOSSARY.md` whose basename is
`GLOSSARY.md` is an include edge. Includes are transitive. For each mention,
the resolver checks both the directory containing the referring glossary and
the selected project root as bases. It normalizes each result, rejects paths
outside the project, converts retained candidates back to project-relative
paths for indexed lookup, and includes every distinct existing regular file
whose real path also remains inside the project. The referring file itself is
ignored, canonical paths are included only once, and cycles therefore
terminate without special author syntax. Escaped candidates are discarded; a
mention with no contained resolution is rejected with one bounded diagnostic.
A valid directory-relative `../../GLOSSARY.md` may therefore normalize to the
project root and remain contained even though the project-root-relative
candidate is discarded.

The governing file followed by a depth-first, source-order traversal of its
first-seen includes forms one ordered glossary. Each file contributes the rows
from its first Markdown table in table order. This is an explicit union, not
implicit inheritance from directory placement.

Source Control deliberately resolves from the current working tree even when
it displays historical source or a commit diff. Glossary definitions describe
the project's current vocabulary; YA does not recover or compile a historical
glossary from the viewed revision. Renamed or deleted paths likewise walk the
current tree from the displayed target path and fall back toward the current
project root.

Every governing and included path is resolved through the existing project-
containment boundary. Public-share rendering may use a glossary only when that
file is part of the share's explicit file capability or captured snapshot; a
share must never disclose an otherwise unshared current glossary through an
include. V1 does not add either authorization to existing share creation, so
public session and file shares remain unannotated. Adding hints to a future
share requires an explicit captured-artifact or share-capability decision; it
must not reuse the authenticated project artifact route.

## Glossary term grammar

The first Markdown table outside fenced or indented code supplies glossary
rows. A table-shaped example inside backtick/tilde fences or an indented code
block is inert. The first column is the term pattern, the second is the
definition, and later columns are references or other metadata that do not
enter the tooltip.

A top-level comma in the term cell separates independent phrase patterns. A
Markdown-escaped comma is literal. Each phrase is interpreted separately:

Here a token is one maximal visible non-whitespace run; hyphens and other
attached punctuation remain literal parts of that token. Whitespace separates
tokens and is normalized when optional tokens are omitted.

- If the phrase contains no bold span, its entire visible text is required.
- If it contains bold spans, every bold span is required, in source order.
- If any bold span contains ASCII hyphen-minus (`-`), the compiler also emits
  one clone of every resulting phrase form with all hyphen-minuses inside bold
  spans replaced by spaces. Hyphens in non-bold text are not replaced. This
  applies when only part of the phrase is bold as well as when the complete
  phrase is bold.
- Each non-bold visible token is independently optional in its original
  position: the matcher may consume that complete literal token or omit it.
- Omission joins the surviving neighboring pieces with the normalized
  separator implied by the authored phrase; it does not concatenate words.
- Inline code and Markdown escapes contribute their visible literal text.
  Paired emphasis, strong-emphasis, and strikethrough delimiters contribute only
  their visible content. Intraword or unmatched `*`, `_`, and `~` characters are
  literal text rather than formatting to strip.

For example:

```markdown
| term | definition |
| --- | --- |
| per-language **published oracle** | The best published system ... |
| **typed** one-to-one **overlap F1** | An overlap score ... |
```

The first row admits exactly `published oracle` and
`per-language published oracle`. The second admits exactly `typed overlap F1`
and `typed one-to-one overlap F1`. It does **not** admit `typed arbitrary words
overlap F1`: optional non-bold tokens are literal alternatives, never `.*`,
wildcards, edit-distance gaps, or unbounded variation.

Each non-bold token independently contributes a present/absent branch. V1
allows at most two optional non-bold tokens in each comma-separated phrase,
so one phrase produces at most four literal surface forms from optional-token
expansion. A phrase with an ASCII hyphen in bold text doubles those forms once
by replacing all bold ASCII hyphens with spaces, for at most eight before
identical forms are deduplicated. The same cap applies independently to every
comma alternative. This modest compile-time expansion is bounded; it is not
paid again at every source character.

The canonical label for a match is the complete comma-separated alternative
that produced it, stripped of Markdown emphasis but retaining its optional
qualifiers. One concrete surface form maps to one tooltip string. Each
distinct source row that produces that form contributes one paragraph made
from its definition flattened to plain text. When the definition does not
already begin with the canonical label at a phrase boundary, the paragraph is
prefixed with `label: `; case-equivalent alternatives use their first-listed
spelling for that label. Several entries, including conflicts within one
glossary, are concatenated as consecutive paragraphs in governing-closure
order. Directory paths remain artifact metadata and are not added to the
user-visible definition text. Duplicate expansions from the same row
contribute only once. Reference columns are excluded from tooltip text even
when a reference creates an include edge.

## Match semantics

Compilation and matching use the same context-independent Unicode stream:
grapheme-local NFKC normalization, lowercase folding with final sigma
canonicalized to standard sigma, and one separator for each whitespace run.
Matching retains the original UTF-16 start/end range for every emitted code
point, so compatibility expansion, combining marks, and folded case still map
back to exact annotation offsets. Punctuation is literal: punctuation and
spacing inside a declared phrase are consumed by that phrase and do not break
it.

Each authored alternative selects its case policy before optional-token and
hyphen expansion. An all-lowercase alternative matches case-insensitively. An
all-caps alternative matches its exact case. A mixed-case alternative matches
its exact case plus the form produced by uppercasing its first cased character,
allowing sentence-initial capitalization without having to determine sentence
structure. If any explicit lowercase alternative contributes the same
normalized concrete form, that shared form is case-insensitive. Authors can
therefore write `YA, ya` to admit all casing while keeping `YA` alone exact.

Hyphen-minus, Unicode hyphen, and non-breaking hyphen are word characters at
phrase edges. Hyphenated and space-separated forms are therefore distinct
unless the term cell declares both as comma-separated alternatives or derives
the spaced form from an ASCII hyphen-minus inside bold term text. Unicode and
non-breaking hyphens do not receive that derived form. A Markdown list marker
still precedes an eligible match because its following space is the boundary.

A candidate begins and ends at an ordinary text boundary—document edge or a
Unicode whitespace/punctuation boundary other than a lexical hyphen—so a
glossary term does not match as a substring of a larger or hyphenated word.
Those anchors apply only to the phrase edges. Internal punctuation and
whitespace remain part of the literal match, allowing a declared multi-token
phrase to span them in one pass.

Matching follows contiguous visible prose and may cross ordinary inline
formatting boundaries. Links, inline and fenced code, raw HTML, generated
KaTeX, controls, and content that already owns a tooltip are exclusion
boundaries. YA never nests a glossary interaction inside an existing link or
tooltip.

Overlapping matches use one deterministic precedence rule:

1. the match consuming the most visible source text;
2. then the match with the most required bold text;
3. then the earlier glossary in governing-closure order;
4. then the earlier glossary-table row; and
5. then the earlier comma-separated alternative in that row.

Entries producing the same concrete surface form share one automaton terminal
and one candidate span, so their definition paragraphs do not compete under
this overlap rule.

Copying or selecting rendered prose still yields only the original visible
document text. Glossary metadata must not enter ordinary rich or plain-text
copy output, browser search text, Markdown source mapping, or line-target
alignment.

## Presentation and interaction

An annotated term has a restrained link-like tint at normal font weight. It
has no underline and introduces no box, icon, or layout shift. The term wrapper
inherits the surrounding font metrics and adds no padding, border width,
letter spacing, minimum size, or inline width. Enabling hints or replacing an
unannotated render after the matcher becomes ready must not increase line
height or text width, change line breaks, or move source-aligned container
geometry. Browser subpixel quantization at the new inline boundary is
acceptable only when the containing line and paragraph metrics remain
unchanged. Hover, active, and keyboard-focus states may strengthen the tint
enough to make the interaction legible without turning the document into a
field of conventional navigation links.

Pointer hover uses the ordinary tooltip appearance preference:

- Native mode keeps a browser-owned `title` hint.
- Themed mode uses YA's shared tooltip layer, delay, placement, warmth, and
  single-surface ownership.

Holding any pointer button suppresses passive tooltip activation. A native
selection drag crossing a glossary term therefore remains one uninterrupted
text-selection gesture; the term explicitly retains `user-select: text`.

Primary activation—tap or click—and secondary-clicking the term reveal the same
tooltip text and copy that exact text to the clipboard. Touch activation
therefore has an explicit YA surface even when the browser cannot reveal a
native title reliably. The activation surface must not navigate. An activated
definition uses the shared tooltip's enlarged treatment immediately and scrolls
within its viewport cap when long; passive pointer hover remains compact. Both
glossary treatments are one pixel larger than the corresponding ordinary
themed tooltip treatment so definitions remain readable with compact UI
metrics. A secondary click or touch long-press inside the activated definition
stays browser-owned for text selection because activation already copied the
exact definition. Keyboard focus reveals the definition; Enter or Space
performs the same reveal-and-copy action. A
non-collapsed text selection wins over activation so selecting prose does not
unexpectedly write to the clipboard. Successful pointer or keyboard activation
owns that event at the shared tooltip coordinator and stops it before an
enclosing Edit diff, row, or other semantic action can also activate. Selection
does not take that isolation path, preserving the enclosing selection-transfer
behavior; ordinary non-glossary links are unchanged.

The term interaction is semantic and keyboard-operable, not a click handler
inferred from arbitrary generated DOM. Tooltip text remains selectable in
Themed mode under the existing tooltip contract. Clipboard failure may leave
the definition visible but must not report a successful copy.

## Compiled matcher contract

**Why the matcher ships rather than the annotation.** Shipping a compiled
automaton to the client is right *here* and deliberately not the pattern for
every text annotation. It holds when the pattern set is small, closed, and
slowly changing, and the client must re-match the same text repeatedly — a
glossary is a few files' worth of terms, changes only on a glossary edit the
subscription already streams, and is rescanned on every local re-render, so a
round trip per render would be the wrong cost. Where the pattern set is instead
large, open, and filesystem-derived, and the match can be baked once into
content the server is already producing, the annotation ships and the matcher
stays server-side; project path links
([project-path-links](project-path-links.md)) are that case, and the two are
not evidence for each other.

Runtime matching uses one compiled multi-pattern phrase automaton per governing
glossary include-graph version. The intended implementation explicitly expands
the small set of finite literal surface forms, deduplicates them while
retaining every contributing definition paragraph, and indexes them in one
Aho–Corasick-style trie with failure links. It is not a row-by-row regex pass
and does not retry every glossary phrase at every character.

Compilation proceeds conceptually as follows:

1. Parse each comma-separated phrase into required bold spans and independently
   optional non-bold tokens.
2. Expand the present/absent choices into finite literal surface forms, then
   clone forms containing bold ASCII hyphens with those hyphens replaced by
   spaces. No form contains a wildcard or consumes undeclared intervening text.
3. Deduplicate the forms and insert them into one trie, attaching accepted case
   forms, ordered definition paragraphs, and overlap-precedence metadata to
   terminal nodes.
4. Compile failure links so one forward scan recognizes a form beginning at
   any eligible boundary without restarting a phrase loop at each character.
5. Serialize the trie transitions, failure links, terminal metadata, and
   source-version identity.

Artifact version 2 adds the accepted case forms. A legacy version-1 terminal
without that metadata retains the original case-insensitive behavior, so a
new client remains usable with a briefly advertised source-ahead server from
before this pre-release correction.

The automaton scan performs amortized constant transition work per normalized
code point plus one visit per emitted terminal candidate. Let `n` be normalized
rendered code points and `c` be boundary-valid candidate matches. Deterministic
precedence sorting and coordinate-compressed interval admission cost
`O(c log c)`; accepted intervals mark each compressed source segment at most
once. The complete bound is therefore `O(n + c log c)`, with no multiplicative
factor for glossary rows or maximum phrase length after compilation. Sparse
trie transitions keep the serialized artifact small.

Compilation has explicit aggregate limits for include depth, included files,
glossary bytes, rows, phrase length, the two optional tokens per phrase,
expanded forms, alternatives, definition paragraphs per form, and trie states.
Exceeding a limit disables glossary annotation for that governing-graph
version with one bounded diagnostic; ordinary Markdown rendering continues
unchanged. It must never fall back to a per-character regex or phrase loop.

The byte limit binds snapshot acquisition, not only compilation. An obvious
oversized file is rejected from metadata before opening it; every other file is
read through a `remaining graph bytes + 1` bound, and only a stable result within
that bound is decoded or hashed. Includes are acquired and visited depth-first,
so each receives the exact graph remainder after its predecessors rather than
being preloaded under independent per-file limits. Growth after the metadata
check therefore crosses the bounded read by at most one byte and produces the
same aggregate-limit diagnostic.

## In-memory resolution and compiled cache

The server owns the canonical governing-glossary and include-graph resolver and
holds parsed glossaries and compiled automata in process memory. V1 has no
persistent cache format, database table, app-data cache file, project-local
cache, or restart-recovery obligation. A typical project's glossaries total
fewer than 1,000 entries across all subdirectories, so any governing include
closure is smaller still and parsing/compilation is bounded ordinary work.

Governing-file and include-candidate discovery reuse
`ProjectPathIndex.findExisting` from
`packages/server/src/projects/projectPathIndex.ts`. A resolution probes only
the rendered source directory and its parents through the project root, or the
referring-directory/project-root bases for an explicit include. It never needs
a complete project index first. Sparse positive and exact-negative path facts
are shared with path linkification. See
[project-path-links](project-path-links.md) for that index's contract.

The path trie distinguishes unknown, present, and exact absent components; a
directory additionally records whether its immediate listing is complete and
current. Only a complete/current directory may answer arbitrary child absence.
An exact missing `GLOSSARY.md` probe may be cached without listing the directory
or claiming completeness. Initializing the root listing with unknown child
directories is sufficient; no breadth-first project warm is part of glossary
resolution.

The compiled cache maps a governing canonical path to the ordered canonical
dependency paths, their file identities, parsed rows, and compiled automaton.
Unchanged dependency identities reuse that structure across files, sessions,
and Source Control views for the life of the server process. A changed
dependency rebuilds the closure; creation/deletion/rename affecting a governing
candidate re-runs selection. Successful and failed bounded compilations are
cached by the same dependency generation so a bad graph cannot cause repeated
work on every render.

While at least one client subscribes to a project's glossary paths, the server
holds one reference-counted project watcher. Subscription begins with the
currently existing candidate and dependency paths learned by on-demand source
resolution, plus a monotonic process-local generation. It then emits one
`create`, `modify`, or `delete` notification for each relevant glossary-path
change. On Linux, native non-recursive watches attach only to directories
hydrated by source ancestor or include resolution. Missing candidate names in
those directories remain observed, so creating a nearer glossary is detected.
An unknown subtree contains no cached fact and needs no watcher. Watcher
error/overflow marks the generation uncertain and schedules bounded
reconciliation; fallback polling checks only learned candidate/dependency
directories and files. The watcher and poll are torn down when the last
subscriber disconnects.

Resolution and watching share one observation set. When resolution observes a
new candidate directory, the subscription manager attaches or reuses that
directory's watch promptly, through an explicit observation-change handoff from
the resolver or an equivalent call after resolution. The fallback poll is a
missed-event backstop over already-observed candidates; it is not the
notification path by which a newly observed candidate becomes watched. On
ambiguous events or errors, reconciliation stats and re-probes only observed
candidates rather than crawling the project.

`ProjectGlossarySubscriptionManager` implements that as one non-recursive
`fs.watch` per directory holding an observed candidate, filtered to that
directory's observed basenames, resynced on every refresh so a directory
learned since the last one becomes watched and a directory that could not be
watched is retried rather than abandoned. A candidate whose directory does not
exist yet gets no watch and no error; the poll covers it until a later sync's
attach succeeds. First activation treats the resolver's exact observed
identities as its baseline, including explicit absence. If an absent nearer
candidate appears, a present candidate disappears, or a present identity changes
between resolution and the initial scan, activation invalidates the project's
compiled artifacts and advances the snapshot generation before readiness. The
initial snapshot therefore cannot bless a parent-governed artifact after a nearer
`GLOSSARY.md` appeared in that handoff window. A candidate observed after
subscription is seeded from its current identity, so merely learning about an
existing file reports no `create` — which would make the client discard every
artifact it holds. The recursive project-root watch this replaced blocked the Node event loop for
about 2.5 seconds on the motivating project while the artifact itself completed
in 75 ms, and installed watches across an entire unrelated tree — roughly
50,000 mostly irrelevant paths there — to notice a handful of `GLOSSARY.md`
names.

These are deliberately not the directory watches of the project path index
([project-path-links](project-path-links.md)), which keep best-effort cached
facts honest and are torn down whenever byte-budget eviction releases their
project. A glossary subscriber needs its watch to last as long as the
subscription, so the subscription manager owns these for the reference-counted
lifetime described above.

What the subscription does share with that index is retention. Source
resolution hydrates its candidate directories by asking the index, and then
releases its claim, so the next artifact request can find those directories
evicted and re-probe them. A subscription therefore takes one claim of its own
for its whole reference-counted lifetime, dropped when the last subscriber
leaves. That exempts the project from the process-wide byte budget without
exempting it from its own per-project ceiling, so a subscribed project keeps
the paths resolution just proved and still stays bounded. The claim is
retention only: the subscription never reads answers through the index, because
its poll is the missed-event backstop and must do real I/O rather than trust
watcher-backed cache.

First-subscriber activation is one project-scoped single-flight installed before
claim acquisition can yield. Concurrent first subscribers share that one path-
index claim, poll timer, and initial refresh. Subscription creation returns its
release operation synchronously and exposes readiness separately, so socket
cleanup cancels a pending activation without waiting for its claim or refresh.
A late claim is released without starting a timer or publishing a snapshot;
cancellation during initial refresh immediately releases the transferred claim,
timer, and watchers, and invalidates the late refresh result so it publishes
nothing. If a replacement subscriber arrives before that attempt settles, the
same serialized activation driver waits out the invalid attempt, then reacquires
a fresh claim, timer, watch set, and initial refresh; the replacement never
becomes ready on resources the cancelled attempt released. Failed and cancelled
states are inactive and remain subject to the retained-project bound. The
WebSocket adapter installs that synchronous release operation in the
connection's subscription map, then runs readiness outside the serialized frame
queue. Ping, unsubscribe, and unrelated frame admission therefore continue
while filesystem acquisition is pending; a close or unsubscribe invalidates the
installed generation, and its late readiness continuation releases without
publishing.

Observation growth while claim acquisition or initial refresh is pending sets
one refresh-needed flag instead of starting a debounce timer or independent
refresh. The initial refresh reads the latest observation set; growth during
that read is coalesced into its bounded queued pass. Activation settlement is
also part of that serialized driver: it drains a refresh queued after the last
scan before atomically clearing activation ownership, so readiness cannot
publish an initial snapshot that omits a settlement-window observation. An
observation after ownership clears follows the ordinary active-subscription
debounce.

Subscribers joining an already active project share one project-level snapshot-
readiness barrier installed before any await. The first joiner transfers a
pending observation debounce into that barrier; concurrent joiners await the
same promise rather than splitting around the cleared timer. The barrier first
waits for any older scan, then runs one required fresh scan. Observations arriving
while it owns settlement queue onto the barrier, which drains them before its
no-work check and ownership release occur in one synchronous transition. Every
joining subscriber therefore publishes from the same post-observation snapshot,
and discovery cannot silently seed a path only after one joiner's snapshot.
Last-subscriber deactivation advances the activation epoch and clears barrier
ownership, so a replacement subscriber cannot join stale readiness work. No
cancelled or failed activation retains a timer, watcher, path-index claim, or
snapshot barrier.

The client uses the glossary-path stream for invalidation, not governing-file
selection. One tab-local project store owns the active project's subscription
and artifacts above session-keyed route content. Same-project session and file
navigation preserves that store: a ready root artifact is current knowledge
under the active subscription generation and is consumed synchronously without
another artifact request. A source-file artifact whose reported governing path
is root `GLOSSARY.md` may also satisfy the root assistant-prose context once the
subscription snapshot has arrived; that reuse needs no new hierarchy guess or
server query. Leaving the project closes the subscription and clears its
artifacts. Actively claimed/listened and in-flight source contexts stay pinned;
settled inactive contexts use least-recently-used retention bounded to 32
artifacts and 32 MiB of UTF-8 serialized responses. Either inactive limit may
evict a context, whose next visit requests it again; active work may exceed
those inactive limits rather than losing a live render or publishing an
in-flight result into an evicted entry. Every uncached source-context artifact
request goes directly to the server, which resolves the nearest glossary from
the source path. Modification invalidates cached artifacts whose dependency
list names the changed glossary. Creation, deletion, or rename invalidates
cached source contexts below the changed glossary's directory because nearest-
governing resolution may have changed. A snapshot generation change after
reconnect invalidates the tab's cached artifacts without creating one
subscription per queried source. The first snapshot also serial-fences any
artifact request that began without snapshot provenance: if the snapshot
arrives first, an active request restarts under that generation and the earlier
completion cannot publish. A request that already completed before the first
snapshot remains reusable.

Filesystem truth remains authoritative, but cache use must not `stat` directory
mtime on every render or artifact reuse. A current watcher generation makes
cached path/dependency facts reusable synchronously. A cold/invalidated artifact
request reads the actual dependency files before publishing a new generation;
watcher uncertainty or low-rate reconciliation revalidates learned facts after
events may have been missed. Notifications are prompt invalidation, not proof
that external Git operations can never escape observation.

All glossary-specific cache state may disappear on server restart. If later
measurement shows cold parsing or compilation to be material, a persistent
cache below YA app data may be proposed then; it is neither required nor
preferred for v1 and must never write inside the selected project or its Git
metadata.

Glossary initialization is lazy, asynchronous, and single-flight. With the
preference enabled, the first glossary-relevant session or file visit starts a
separate artifact request without delaying the session, message, or file
response that can render ordinary unannotated Markdown. Another artifact
request for the same project and unresolved governing-graph version awaits the
existing promise rather than starting duplicate path validation, parsing, or
compilation. This wait belongs only to glossary initialization; it must never
hold the displayable content response behind a possible glossary result.
When that project already has an active subscription and a ready artifact in
the tab, navigation reuses it without a request; cache reuse is not permission
to delay content while validating or refreshing it.
The source-qualified artifact request also does not wait for the project-wide
glossary-path subscription's initial snapshot. The server resolves the nearest
governing glossary from the supplied source path; the independent path stream
then supplies hierarchy-aware invalidation for later additions, edits, and
deletions. Project discovery is on demand; a large unrelated subtree must not
delay either the document or its glossary artifact.

Glossary work is presentation data and is independent of provider lifetime. An
artifact request or path subscription must never start, wake, or retain a
provider process, and must not count as session liveness. A closed tab leaves
no continuing client obligation; server work already in flight may finish and
populate the process-memory cache.

When the artifact becomes ready, the owning Markdown renderer re-renders from
its original source or sanitized renderer output and replaces the speculative
unannotated presentation. It does not search and mutate the mounted document.
Streaming renderers retain the original block augment needed to apply the same
artifact to already-received blocks. A stale completion is ignored when its
project, governing source path, or dependency version no longer matches the
current render.

Intermediate artifact-state renders that produce the same effective HTML do
not reinsert it or discard imperatively hydrated descendants. When ready
annotation genuinely changes the generated HTML, the owning renderer may
replace it, but embedded media already loaded for that document remounts from
its renderer-lifetime entry without another fetch or a collapsed frame.

For a bounded valid glossary graph, initial path validation, parsing, and
compilation should complete in under one second on the project's ordinary
development baseline. This is a cold-work budget rather than permission to
block first paint. Aggregate limits and ordinary unannotated rendering remain
the fallback when a graph cannot be compiled safely.

Client render boundaries consume the same serializable compiled artifact
rather than implementing another parser or matcher. The authenticated delivery
contract is one optional-source request,
`GET /api/projects/:projectId/glossary-artifact[?sourcePath=...]`, plus one
project-scoped glossary-path subscription. Omitting `sourcePath` selects the
project-root assistant-prose context. The subscription snapshot contains the
existing candidates and dependencies learned by on-demand resolution plus its
generation; the project-wide change stream then reports glossary additions,
modifications, and deletions. For server-rendered HTML, annotation transforms
the sanitized renderer output before insertion; it is not a document-wide
mounted-DOM rewrite. An older server's missing `glossary-tooltips` capability
means the client makes no unsupported request or subscription and renders
ordinary Markdown without glossary annotations.

Authenticated project-contained Markdown links use the shared FileViewer
route, including browser new-tab gestures, so project documents retain their
project/source context and the same glossary boundary. An intercepted link
opened in a file-viewer modal resolves glossary hints from the FileViewer's
project context. An authenticated absolute local-file link opened from a
session uses that session project context and its root glossary/include graph,
even when the file lies outside the project. The legacy standalone local-file
HTML shell remains for surfaces with no selected-project authority and stays
unannotated.

## Render-boundary implementation plan

The implementation followed this sequence:

1. **Grammar and phrase-automaton compiler.** Add a browser-free shared
   glossary parser, recursive contained includes, finite surface-form
   expansion, multi-paragraph terminals, serialized trie format, matcher, and
   adversarial budget tests.
2. **Governing-glossary resolver and in-memory cache.** Reuse
   `ProjectPathIndex.findExisting` for contained ancestor and include lookup,
   then add dependency-identity invalidation, current-working-tree Source
   Control semantics, process-memory bounds, and bounded diagnostics.
3. **Compatibility review.** Inspect the required stable-server corpus and
   approve an optional permanent capability plus exact absent-capability
   fallback before adding the client delivery contract.
4. **Non-blocking artifact readiness.** Start one background, capability-gated
   artifact request from a relevant project visit, share concurrent work, and
   publish a versioned ready result without delaying ordinary content.
5. **Shared Markdown annotation boundary.** Feed the matcher into each owning
   Markdown renderer. Annotation happens on parsed tokens or sanitized renderer
   output before insertion, never through a document-wide mounted-DOM search.
6. **Term interaction and style.** Add one semantic term primitive and extend
   the shared tooltip coordinator for activation reveal/copy, Native/Themed
   ownership, keyboard behavior, selection precedence, and clipboard failure.
7. **Surface parity.** Wire assistant prose, FileViewer, Read/Write, fixed-font
   Markdown, Edit/diff, Source Control, standalone local documents, and bounded
   public-share contexts; raw/source modes remain untouched.
8. **Performance and visual acceptance.** Benchmark cold compilation, warm
   process-memory reuse, and linear scans; then capture and inspect desktop and
   phone renders with ordinary, hovered, focused, and tapped terms.

The shared compiler, resolver, and renderer annotation are the owning
invariants. Individual viewers must not grow bespoke glossary regexes, ancestor
walks, or click handlers.

## Verification plan

Grammar and matcher tests cover:

- no-bold phrases, one and several bold spans, edge and intervening optional
  tokens, bold-hyphen space clones including partially bold phrases, the
  two-optional-token cap, comma alternatives, and escaped commas;
- independently present/absent optional tokens, rejection of a third optional
  token, and rejection of arbitrary gaps;
- lowercase-insensitive, all-caps-exact, mixed-case and explicit-alternative
  matching; compatibility and combining normalization; whitespace, literal
  delimiter punctuation, phrase-edge boundaries, and stable source offsets;
- fenced/indented table-shaped examples and matches spanning ordinary inline
  formatting;
- same-form definitions within and across glossaries, concatenated paragraph
  order, and overlap precedence;
- state/byte/row limits, file-identity invalidation, failed-compilation caching,
  and process-memory bounds; and
- a long nonmatching document plus dense disjoint candidates, proving the scan
  has no glossary-row factor and overlap admission follows its indexed bound.

Resolution tests cover same-directory and nearest-ancestor governing selection,
root-governed project prose, independent multi-file diff sections, project-
relative and referring-directory-relative includes, transitive cycles,
canonical deduplication, self-exclusion, containment and symlink escape,
current-working-tree Source Control behavior, deletion/rename, public-share
scoping, dependency-change invalidation, warm in-process reuse, cold rebuild
after server restart, and no glossary-cache writes to the project or YA app
data.

Renderer and interaction tests cover every Markdown-eligible surface, the
source/raw exclusion, existing links/code/KaTeX/tooltips, original-text copy,
selection precedence, Native/Themed exclusive ownership, mouse hover, touch
reveal, exact clipboard text, keyboard reveal/copy, and clipboard failure.

Final browser captures at 1920×1080 and 375×812 confirm a slight
non-underlined tint without layout shift, readable tooltips in both light and
dark themes, and a touch reveal that does not obscure the triggering term or
leave stale tooltip state.

## Acceptance boundary

The feature is complete when, after asynchronous artifact readiness, every
eligible user-turn or Markdown YA view uses one governing current glossary and
the same project-contained include semantics, compiled artifact,
multi-definition paragraphs, match precedence, metric-neutral visual
treatment, and reveal/copy interaction; warm scans are linear in rendered
text; first paint never waits for glossary compilation; same-project session
navigation reuses current subscribed artifacts without another query; and
browsers with the preference disabled, projects without a controlling
glossary, and surfaces in source/raw mode remain observably unchanged.
