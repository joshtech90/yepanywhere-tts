# Session Reactivation (message-less resume)

> Reactivation is a planned server primitive that spawns a live harness process

Topic: session-reactivation

Status: **implemented** (2026-06-17, after the kzahel merge). The message-less
spawn primitive already existed in the supervisor; this work exposed it as a
public `Supervisor.reactivateSession`, a `POST …/reactivate` route, and a
client Activate button. See *As built* below.

Naming: the user-facing button label is **"Activate"** (from the client's point
of view a reaped session simply isn't active). The server primitive / this
topic is **reactivate**. Avoid "reattach" — there is no live process to attach
to; reactivation spawns a *fresh* harness process bound to the session id and
replays its history. "Revive" is an acceptable synonym. Candidate glossary row.
<!-- unconfirmed: 2026-06-16 -->

## Motivation

A YA-launched session whose harness process was reaped reports as not-owned
(ownership is purely "is there a live process right now":
`getProcessForSession` → `self`, else `external`/`none`,
`routes/sessions.ts:1965-1980`). On such a session the model panel can only
show **"No active process"**, because the full model options come from
`getProcessModels(processId)` — a *process*-level call (`client.ts:865`); there
is no provider-level model list. So today the only way to make a reaped session
configurable again is to **send a turn**, which is the wrong gesture when the
user just wants to change the model.

We want a button that brings the process live with no turn, then reveals the
full options once the process exists. The UI it plugs into is the unified model
panel in `ModelSwitchModal` (Model/Info tabs).

## What already existed (the plan overstated the server work)

The message-less spawn primitive was **already present**, just not exposed for
resume:

- `Supervisor.createSession` spawns a process that idles on the queue with **no
  initial message** (the two-phase "create then send" flow), and the private
  `createProviderSession`/`createRealSession` it calls already accept a
  `resumeSessionId` and start with no message
  (`Supervisor.ts:1313-1337, 727-748`), registering it as owned
  (`registerProcess(process, !resumeSessionId)`). So it is **provider-agnostic** —
  Claude and Codex reactivate with no synthetic turn; no empty-turn fallback was
  needed.
- What was missing was only a **public** entry point combining the two (resume
  an existing session id, no message) and a route. `POST …/resume` mandates a
  message (`routes/sessions.ts:2890`), but that requirement lives in the route,
  not the supervisor.
- Still true: **no provider-level model list** — only
  `getProcessModels(processId)` — so a live process is genuinely required to show
  options; reactivate is the right primitive, not a client-only shortcut.

## As built

- **`Supervisor.reactivateSession(projectPath, resumeSessionId, mode?, settings?)`**
  — idempotent (returns the existing live process if already owned); preempts an
  idle worker at capacity, else throws; otherwise calls
  `createProviderSession`/`createRealSession` with the `resumeSessionId` and no
  message.
- **`POST /api/projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId/reactivate`** — resolves
  provider/model/executor from the persisted YA launch record
  (`SessionMetadata.requestedModel`/`provider`, populated by `persistLaunchMetadata`),
  returns `{ processId, permissionMode, modeVersion }`.
- **Client:** `api.reactivateSession`; `ModelSwitchModal`'s "No active process"
  note becomes an Activate button (`onActivate`); `SessionPage` calls reactivate
  and flips `status` to `{ owner: "self", processId }`, after which the existing
  `processId`-keyed effect loads models and the full options replace the note.
- Coverage: `supervisor.test.ts` asserts message-less resume + ownership +
  idempotency.

## The plan

### Server primitive

Expose a message-less reactivate. Two shapes considered; pick at implementation:

- **`POST …/reactivate`** (new route), or
- **`warmOnly: true` flag on the existing resume route** that skips the
  `UserMessage` requirement and the turn delivery.

Behavior:

1. Start the harness process for the session id (provider resolved as resume
   does: metadata provider → reader), load history, **deliver no user turn**.
2. Leave it in the post-turn **idle** state; subject it to the **same reaping /
   idle-lifecycle** as any other idle owned process (don't leak an immortal
   idle process).
3. Return `{ processId }`; ownership for the session becomes
   `{ owner: "self", processId }`.

Server files this touches: `supervisor/Process.ts`, `supervisor/types.ts`, and a
route in `routes/sessions.ts` or `routes/processes.ts`.

### Client integration (the planned UI half)

In `ModelSwitchModal`, the `!processId` Model-tab branch becomes an **Activate**
button (replacing the static "No active process" note) with an in-flight
"Activating…" state; the modal stays open. `SessionPage` supplies an
`onActivate` that calls the reactivate endpoint and, on success, flips
`status` to `{ owner: "self", processId }`.

No extra client reveal logic is needed: `ModelSwitchModal`'s existing
`processId`-keyed `useEffect` fires when `processId` appears, fetches models, and
the full options replace the spinner. (Minor: set `loading = true` at the start
of that fetch so the transition shows a spinner rather than a flash.)

## Cost surfacing

[[provider-context-economics]] requires that **no session action hide a
full-replay price**. Clarify before shipping: a message-less reactivate spawns
the process but likely incurs **no provider billing until the first real turn**
(stateless providers replay+bill per turn; idling the process invokes no model).
If that holds, reactivation's marginal cost over "just send your next message"
is ~zero on the provider side (local process resources only). Confirm this
against the provider's resume/load path; if reactivation itself triggers any
billed provider call, the button must surface it per the economics rule.

## Open questions

- Endpoint shape: new `reactivate` route vs `warmOnly` flag on resume.
- Should reactivate optionally **apply pending config** (the model the user just
  picked) at spawn, or strictly spawn-then-configure via the normal model-switch
  path?
- Idle-process lifecycle: reaping timer parity with post-turn idle processes;
  what happens if the user reactivates then walks away.
- Sibling concern (task029): requested-model persistence may let a model choice
  take effect on the *next* natural turn without reactivating at all —
  reactivation is for users who want the process live *now*. Keep both; they
  serve different intents.

## Coordination (resolved)

Built after task029 landed and the kzahel merge settled, so the supervisor was
stable and uncontended. The implementation did not need `Process.ts` changes —
it reused the existing `createProviderSession` resume path — so the earlier
concern about editing under task029 did not materialize.
