# Android FCM Push

Topic: android-fcm-push

Status: Approved architecture direction. The credential-free broker v1 is
implemented and tested. The Android shell now has a minimal FID registration
and receive probe, and direct Firebase Console delivery has been verified on a
physical device. Live broker delivery, Android broker enrollment, and the YA
server subscription protocol are not implemented.

## Product Boundary

YA servers and relays remain self-hostable. The normal published Android app
belongs to the YA Firebase project and uses a YA-hosted push broker because the
Firebase service-account credentials for that app cannot be distributed to
arbitrary server installations.

The push broker is not an account system or application-traffic relay. It
should know only what it needs to register Android installations, authorize and
rate-limit notification requests, and dispatch them through FCM.

The planned published service endpoint is `https://push.yepanywhere.com`. The
public name and protocol should use provider-neutral push terminology even
though FCM is the first delivery implementation.

Existing browser Web Push/VAPID remains supported independently. Native FCM is
an additional Android delivery target, not a replacement for self-hosted Web
Push.

## Service Boundary

The hosted push broker should be a separate runtime service from the relay. The
two services may share physical hosting, but they should not share a process,
event loop, database, or delivery credentials.

The official push broker is Linux-hosted infrastructure. Windows is not a
supported deployment target, so the push-broker package test command exits
before loading broker dependencies on native Windows. Linux CI remains the
authoritative broker verification environment; macOS development runs may
continue exercising the same package tests.

This preserves the relay's latency-sensitive opaque forwarding path, allows
broker persistence and outbound provider calls to proceed independently, and
keeps Firebase credentials outside the relay's otherwise narrow trust boundary.
Broker deployments and restarts should not disconnect live relay circuits, and
the public push endpoint should be movable without changing the relay endpoint.

## Trust Model

After a successful SRP login, the YA Android app and the user's YA server are
fully trusted with each other's device-specific push material. The operator is
responsible for protecting secrets stored by their server, just as they are for
existing auth state and VAPID keys.

The hosted broker has narrower trust:

- it alone holds the official Firebase service-account credentials;
- it may store Android installation identifiers, current FCM delivery
  registrations, subscription associations, optional server/relay labels,
  privacy preferences, and delivery/rate-limit metadata;
- it does not receive SRP passwords or relay session keys; and
- it must not become a transcript or general YA message service.

An FCM registration does not need to be hidden from the Android app or its
authenticated YA server. Keeping the broker's current registration mapping is
primarily a delivery-lifecycle convenience, not a trust boundary between the
phone and server.

## Login And Push Enrollment

The default server-login path is the existing username/password SRP flow over a
direct or relay connection. Push enrollment happens only after that login:

1. The user logs the YA Android app into a YA server with SRP.
2. The user enables native notifications for that server.
3. The Android app creates a device push subscription through the configured
   broker.
4. The Android app gives the resulting subscription credentials to the trusted
   YA server over the authenticated, encrypted connection.
5. The YA server stores those credentials in its data directory and uses them
   for future notification requests.

A future QR or deep-link flow may make the SRP device login easier. It is an
optional login shortcut, not a prerequisite for push and not a separate push
authorization model.

## Device Push Subscription

A device push subscription is conceptually similar to the Web Push
subscription YA already stores. It is a one-way capability allowing one YA
server to request notifications for one Android installation.

Its conceptual fields are:

- broker endpoint;
- opaque subscription id; and
- high-entropy send secret.

These names describe the authority boundary, not a committed wire schema. The
opaque id identifies broker state; the send secret authorizes delivery. The
broker should store a verifier or hash rather than plaintext when its chosen
authentication scheme permits that.

One subscription per YA-server/Android-installation relationship permits
independent attribution, rate limiting, muting, and revocation. It is not a
chat room, a relay circuit, or an address that another server can discover by
username.

The broker maps the stable subscription to the Android installation's current
FCM delivery registration. The YA server may also know that registration, but
it should not need to use it as its durable destination.

The credential-free broker milestone separates two capabilities:

- an installation-management secret creates and revokes server-specific
  subscriptions and replaces the installation's current provider target; and
- each subscription has its own send secret, which can request notifications
  for that installation but cannot read or replace its provider target.

Both secrets are generated by the broker, returned once, and stored only as
verifiers by the broker. Unknown, revoked, and incorrectly authenticated
capabilities have the same externally visible failure.

## Credential-Free Broker V1 Contract

The standalone TypeScript service under `packages/push-broker/` exposes:

- `POST /v1/installations` to register one opaque FCM delivery target and
  receive an installation id and management secret;
- authenticated replacement and deletion beneath
  `/v1/installations/:installationId`;
- authenticated subscription creation and revocation beneath that
  installation; and
- `POST /v1/subscriptions/:subscriptionId/notifications` to submit one generic
  intent with the subscription send secret.

The send route never accepts a provider target. Installation and send secrets
are random 256-bit values returned once and retained by the broker only as
SHA-256 verifiers. Revocation prevents later requests; a provider submission
already in flight cannot be recalled.

Defined JSON bodies are limited to 8 KiB and reject unknown fields. Mutation
responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`. Invalid bodies return `400`, missing
JSON content type returns `415`, oversized bodies return `413`, unknown or
unauthorized capabilities return `404`, subscription-cap exhaustion returns
`409`, and rate limits return `429` with `Retry-After`.

The credential-free provider contract waits at most ten seconds. Accepted
provider submissions return `202`, retryable failures return `503`, and
rejections return `502`. There is no broker-owned queue or retry loop.

The conservative process-local limits are:

- 120 mutation requests per minute per source IP;
- 10 installation registrations per hour per source IP;
- 30 notification submissions per minute per subscription;
- 120 notification submissions per minute per installation; and
- 20 active subscriptions per installation.

These counters are bounded in memory and reset on restart. Forwarding headers
affect their source-IP key only when the immediate peer is in the explicit
trusted-proxy configuration. Durable or distributed quotas remain deployment
work.

The fake provider is non-production only. FCM mode requires an explicit
Firebase project id and uses Application Default Credentials. The process
binds to loopback by default; explicit host, port, data directory, provider
timeout, log level, and trusted-proxy settings are authoritative.

## Delivery

The intended flow is:

```text
YA server
  -> authenticated notification request for one device push subscription
  -> YA-hosted push broker
  -> FCM
  -> YA Android app / Android notification tray
```

The broker authenticates the subscription, applies payload policy and rate
limits, resolves the current FCM delivery registration, and submits the
message. Notification requests do not choose an arbitrary FCM registration or
relay username.

The credential-free v1 submits directly to its configured provider and returns
only after that submission succeeds or fails. It has no durable delivery queue,
retry loop, acknowledgement protocol, or delivery guarantee. Those mechanisms
must be justified by observed live-provider behavior before being added.

The broker may store a normalized relay origin, relay username, and
user-visible server label with the subscription. Those fields support
attribution, diagnostics, and secondary rate limits; they are not notification
authorization.

Primary abuse controls are based on the subscription, Android installation,
and source IP. Relay-origin/username limits may supplement them. The v1 limits
are recorded above; durable quotas, coalescing keys, retry policy, and
idempotency rules should be chosen with live broker evidence.

## Notification Privacy Modes

The architecture supports two user choices:

### Generic

The notification contains no user-generated content. The broker receives a
small intent such as "pending input" or "session finished" plus opaque routing
metadata, and sends fixed notification copy. Opening the notification fetches
details from the user's YA server over its normal authenticated connection.

This is the conservative default direction.

The credential-free v1 accepts only four fixed intents: approval required,
input required, session completed, and session failed. They all produce the
same bounded visible notification copy. The provider payload contains the
intent and opaque subscription id so the app can fetch current details from its
authenticated YA server.

### Descriptive

The user explicitly opts into notification title/body text passing in
plaintext through the YA push broker and Google FCM. This may include bounded
project, session, question, or approval text. The UI must explain that
privacy/functionality trade-off before enabling it.

The broker should validate and forward descriptive payloads without becoming a
durable content store. Exact retention, logging redaction, payload size limits,
and user-facing consent copy belong to the implementation contract.

End-to-end-encrypted rich notification bodies are possible future work, not a
requirement for the first useful Android push path.

## FCM Registration Lifecycle

FCM's delivery registration can change over the lifetime of an Android
installation. The broad ownership rule is simple:

- the Android app uses the supported Firebase SDK lifecycle to learn its
  current delivery registration;
- the broker associates that current registration with stable YA device push
  subscriptions; and
- ordinary FCM refresh should not require the user to repeat SRP login or
  recreate otherwise-valid server/device relationships.

The first physical-device probe pins Firebase Messaging `25.1.1` through BoM
`34.16.0`, opts into FID targeting, and receives the current FID through
`FirebaseMessagingService.onRegistered()`. Firebase auto-initialization
registered a clean app installation without activity code, a custom background
job, or a retry loop. Clearing the dev app's data caused a different FID to be
minted and delivered through the same callback.

The current probe logs that FID only in debug builds. It does not upload it to
the broker. The eventual enrollment implementation should treat every
`onRegistered()` callback as an opportunity to replace the broker
installation's current target without recreating its server-specific
subscriptions.

The FID and broker installation capability are native installation state. A
hosted foreground client does not need either value. The narrow bridge seam is
server-specific push enrollment: native code may create a broker subscription
and return that subscription's one-time send capability to the already
authenticated hosted client for installation on the YA server. The FID and
installation-management secret stay native.

Do not prescribe a retry schedule, offline recovery algorithm,
stale-registration threshold, or deletion policy here. Those details still
need evidence from the pinned SDK against the live broker.

Before this lifecycle is treated as complete, exercise real target refresh,
offline app/broker recovery, reinstall or cleared-app-data behavior, invalid
FCM send responses, and eventual stale-record cleanup. That implementation
work should produce the concrete observable contract.

## Future Apple Delivery

A future YA iOS app should use the same device push subscription and broker
service rather than introducing another public notification service.

The initial iOS direction is to use Firebase Cloud Messaging's Apple-platform
integration. The iOS app registers through the FCM SDK, Firebase maps that
registration to Apple Push Notification service (APNs), and the broker submits
through the same FCM server interface used for Android. The Firebase project
must be configured with the YA app's APNs authentication material, but YA
servers continue to use the same provider-neutral subscription contract.

This keeps the first iOS delivery path small while leaving direct APNs delivery
as a possible later broker adapter. Adding such an adapter should not require a
new public hostname or a new YA-server subscription model.

iOS silent/background delivery is opportunistic and subject to platform
throttling. The dependable initial product path should use visible
notifications and fetch current details from the authenticated YA server when
the user opens them. Exact Apple notification behavior must be validated during
iOS implementation.

## Self-Hosted And Configured Variants

The mainstream path is:

- published YA Android app;
- official YA Firebase project and push broker;
- any user-operated YA server; and
- either the hosted relay, a self-hosted relay, or a direct connection.

A source-built Android app may expose build-time configuration for alternate
service URLs and may use an operator-owned Firebase project and push broker.
That is an advanced distribution path, not a requirement for ordinary
self-hosting of YA servers and relays.

Explicit broker, relay, and server configuration is authoritative. A client or
server must not silently replace an operator-selected endpoint with the hosted
default.

## Deferred Implementation Decisions

- YA-server storage/routes, their Android client contract, and their
  compatibility gates.
- Live broker validation of FID sends and provider failures.
- Registration refresh, invalidation, offline recovery, and stale cleanup.
- Durable quotas, coalescing, acknowledgement, and delivery-result semantics.
- App-attestation requirements for official and source-built distributions.
- Exact generic/descriptive notification settings and disclosure copy.
- Whether a later iOS release continues through FCM or adds direct APNs as a
  broker delivery adapter.
