# Turn-rail marker layout (hit targets + de-cluster spread)

> The scrollbar turn-rail (`UserTurnNavigator`) draws a dash + dot per user
> turn. Their hit/hover targets must match the visible marks — no oversized
> zones that activate blank space, and no z-order confusion in dense clusters.
> This is option **B** (targets sized to neighbor gaps) shipped, plus option
> **A** (de-cluster spread) enabled at a cozy min-gap via one internal constant.

## The bug (root cause)

Each marker's hit/hover target was a **fixed 22px box** (`height:22px;
margin-top:-11px`) centered on a ~3px dash. Markers render at their true scroll
positions with no de-clustering, so in a cluster the 22px boxes overlap heavily;
their union reaches ~9px above the topmost dash and ~13px below the bottommost
and blankets the gaps — blank space activates a marker. Overlap + stacking (later
= lower markers on top) means hovering a cluster activates the *lower* overlapping
marker, so the blue activation sits below the pointer. It was never a coordinate
offset — the `%` hitbox, the dash, and the tooltip all share `topPct ×
trackHeight`; the target was simply far larger than the mark and never tiled.

## B — hit targets sized to neighbor gaps (shipped)

Per marker, the hit/hover target height = `clamp(min(gapAbove, gapBelow),
MARKER_HIT_MIN_PX, MARKER_HIT_MAX_PX)`, centered on the dash (set inline; the dash
line and dot center via `top:50%`). So targets tile without overlap, never reach
past the midpoint to a neighbor, and are capped for isolated/edge markers — blank
space no longer activates, and the topmost overlapping marker no longer wins a
cluster. Dashes stay at their **true** positions.

## A — de-cluster spread (enabled, cozy)

`MARKER_SPREAD_PX` is the single tuning constant: **0** = accurate/status quo;
**9** (current) = a cozy gap just above the dot footprint (~6px circle + ~1px
shadow) so dashes/dots stay tight but non-overlapping. When > 0, dense markers
are pushed apart to at least that px gap before targets are sized, so the dashes
spread to match their targets. Sparse markers keep true positions; in extremely
long sessions `N×gap` can exceed the rail and markers pile up at the bottom.

The spread is **L2-optimal and local**: it minimizes total squared displacement
from true positions subject to `pos[i+1] − pos[i] ≥ gap`. Substituting `w_i =
y_i − i·gap` turns the gap constraint into "w non-decreasing", i.e. isotonic
regression, solved by **pool-adjacent-violators** in O(n) (`spreadMinGap`).
Consequence the user asked for: far-apart clusters keep their true positions and
spreading one cluster never shoves it into the next — only genuinely colliding
runs are pooled and spread (to exactly `gap`, centered on their centroid).

Both paths feed a per-marker `renderTopPct` (= `topPct` when spread is off); the
dash, dot, hit target, and preview label all use it, so they stay aligned.

## Config visibility

`MARKER_SPREAD_PX`, `MARKER_HIT_MIN_PX`, `MARKER_HIT_MAX_PX` are internal tuning
constants in `UserTurnNavigator.tsx`, **not** user-facing settings. If a setting
is ever wanted, expose `MARKER_SPREAD_PX` (0 → max) as the one knob.

## Search preview hover stability

Ctrl-S search mode renders match-preview excerpts beside the turn rail, and
hovering a preview may expand it into a richer multi-line facsimile. Expansion
must keep the preview's right edge anchored: the visual card may grow leftward,
but it must not translate its hitbox horizontally away from the pointer. A
horizontal shift makes pointer-leave collapse the preview, which moves it back
under the pointer and creates a hover/collapse loop.

Preview-label hover is presentation-only: it may expand the hovered card, but it
must not recenter or page the preview window, because moving the label stack
under the pointer causes the same hover/collapse loop. The right-side rail
markers may still recenter/page the preview window on hover, since their hit
targets stay fixed while the text labels move. A click on either a marker or a
preview label is a committed jump target; closing search after that jump should
leave the full transcript centered on the clicked row rather than restoring the
pre-search scroll position.

Marker-hover paging is sticky within a horizontal band. Once a hashmark owns the
preview window, entering another marker at the same pointer Y must not page the
window; the user may move horizontally between the rail marks and their preview
text without a flicker. Paging to a different marker happens when the pointer
actually moves up/down to another band, or after the pointer fully leaves and the
preview state clears.

Active search previews at the rail edges anchor inside the rail instead of
remaining vertically centered. A first-turn / top-edge hit uses the rail top as
the preview top, and a bottom-edge hit uses the rail bottom as the preview
bottom, so at least the hit line remains visible instead of slipping under the
session header or footer chrome. Non-active hover expansion keeps the existing
center position so hovering a preview label remains presentation-only.

Pre-hover search previews, including the active hit, are dense one-line hit
summaries rather than mini cards. The collapsed box height must be large enough
for one readable text line, and the layout pitch should leave only about a
one-pixel visual gap between boxes; do not reclaim height by clipping the text
line into a hairline. Their displayed text is re-excerpted around the first
match so every shown label exposes the needle on its single visible line. Hover
expansion may still show the richer multi-line context from the search
projection.

Follow-up wish: restore the older pointer-driven rail browse behavior where
moving the mouse near the right-side turn rail shifts which turn previews are
shown, without requiring a committed scroll/jump first. Combine that with the
dense preview contract above: before mouseover/focus each candidate stays a
single first-match line rather than a whole-turn card; mouseover/focus expands
only that candidate to richer whole-turn or multi-line context. The preview
window may follow vertical pointer bands near the rail, but the marker hit
targets stay fixed and must not reintroduce the hover/collapse loops above.

## Bottom-bar position age

The composer bottom bar may show a contextual turn-position age immediately to
the left of the session last-activity age. The contract is narrow:

- A hovered/focused turn-rail marker owns the contextual age while its preview
  tooltip is active.
- Otherwise, when the transcript is not following the live tail, ordinary
  scrollbar movement owns the contextual age. Use the most recent visible turn
  end; if no turn end is visible because the viewport is inside a long turn,
  fall back to the timestamp nearest the middle of the visible transcript.
- Hover/focus wins over scroll position. The contextual age clears when the
  preview clears, the rail unmounts, or the transcript returns to follow mode.
- Marker-hover age comes from the marker anchor's message timestamp, not from
  rendered DOM text or the preview label. Normal turn notches use the user
  prompt's timestamp; search-mode anchors may use the row they target.
  Scrollbar-position age comes from the visible transcript rows and their
  source message timestamps.
- The bottom bar renders the contextual age as its own neighbor chip. It is not
  gated by the ordinary session last-activity chip's stale threshold; compare
  against the session last-activity compact label even when that label is
  hidden, and suppress the contextual chip only when the two labels match.
- The chip is informational only: noninteractive, muted relative to warning
  liveness/status chips, and formatted as `at X ago` so it reads as a position
  qualifier for the adjacent session activity age.
