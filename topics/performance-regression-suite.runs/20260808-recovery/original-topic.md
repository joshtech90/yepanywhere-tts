# Performance Regression Suite: 2026-08-08 Source Record

Status: immutable source record for the 2026-08-08 survey and recovery series.
The current contract lives in
[`../../performance-regression-suite.md`](../../performance-regression-suite.md),
and the curated result digest lives in [`../README.md`](../README.md).

> The performance regression suite is YA's configuration-driven black-box test family for comparing server and real-browser latency, retained memory, and correctness across project, session, turn, payload, cache-budget, and concurrent-client scales.

Topic: performance-regression-suite

## Contract

`scripts/perf-suite/run.mjs` imports no YA modules from the measured checkout.
It creates detached project worktrees from the immutable fixture revision,
generates deterministic provider files whose `cwd` values use those worktrees,
starts an isolated execution checkout on non-production ports and app-data
paths, verifies fixture-derived API and rendering invariants, then records one
JSON result. Execution, fixture, and harness identities remain distinct. The
harness identity is content-addressed and path-scoped so unrelated shared-
worktree commits or edits cannot relabel a measurement.

Every spawned YA process carries a unique `ya-perf-suite-` marker in argv and
`PERF_RUN_ID`, starts in its own process group, and enters a run-local
PID/PGID/port manifest. Browser helpers inherit the environment marker. A
marker-family sweep must be clean before measurement. After every repetition
and on failure or signal paths, `perf-sweep --kill --kill-group` is followed by
a report-only verification. Surviving debris fails the run even when reaping
succeeds, because it is evidence of a harness or measured-lifecycle defect.
Before starting a measured leg, orchestration removes or rejects its prior
output target; a crashed invocation must never be classified from a stale
nonempty result left by an earlier run.

The server driver uses public HTTP routes and the maintenance listener. Heap
ratchets use an inspector-requested full garbage collection followed by the
minimum of seven heap samples; RSS uses their median. Current execution source
also emits additive session-detail clocks and bounded cache/V8 gauges. Older
checkpoints retain black-box totals and explicitly report unavailable owner
telemetry rather than synthetic zeros.

The browser driver adds the measured checkout's React dev client and one real
page per configured client. It enables glossary hints in browser storage;
automatic bare project-path linking has no saved enable switch. Each cache mode
warms and revisits a three-session ring, then proves under a held refresh that a
cached final transcript is usable before network completion while a zero budget
remains blank. The artificial hold is excluded from ordinary timings. Cold,
warm, and append results separately record readable text, glossary annotation,
project-path anchors, and the latest supported final display. Server and
browser measurements are distinct ratchet universes. Per-page Chrome DevTools
Protocol snapshots count live-plus-detached nodes, documents, event listeners,
and layout objects. Browser-wide snapshots inventory processes at startup,
after each cache mode loads, and after append. Linux results add per-process and
per-type RSS, PSS, and private bytes from `/proc`; a total is absent unless
every process in that snapshot was readable. Other platforms retain process
identity and type without claiming native byte totals.

The `focused-append` scale point is the selected-session critical-path
contrast: one project, one session, one cache-disabled browser page, and one
newly appended turn. It uses the same file watcher, incremental request,
MessageList, server-detail, and mutation-mark clocks as the fleet scenarios,
but its separate history key excludes their multi-file, multi-page fan-out
contention. The browser working-set size is an explicit scenario dimension;
the cache proof always leaves the selected route before testing refresh, so a
one-session ring cannot turn same-route navigation into a false timeout.

The `built-client` driver prepares one production build before host sampling and
records its command, elapsed time, revision, and clean marker sweep without
charging it to a timed leg. Each repetition uses two fresh production servers.
The server leg measures process spawn through `/api/projects` readiness to the
expected transcript needle in a selected-session response. The browser leg
serves `packages/client/dist`; browser launch is excluded, and an init-script
`MutationObserver` independently marks readable text, glossary annotation, and
project-path anchors during the first selected-session navigation. Direct and
browser legs do not share a server process, so the direct probe cannot warm the
browser leg's YA caches. These are DOM-readiness clocks, not paint timestamps.

The `specialized` driver covers owned-provider and public-share contracts in
two fresh server legs. The owned leg selects an out-of-process simulated
provider-runtime worker while retaining YA's real runtime host, proxy,
supervisor, subscription, augmentation, and idle-reap paths. Its deterministic
thinking-capable stream must publish the configured chunk count and bytes, a
raw final assistant message, and then the same-id enriched replacement. Once
the process reports verified idle and its final viewer unsubscribes, the
time-compressed idle deadline must release ownership. The public-share leg
creates a real frozen share against a local simulated relay, validates its
bounded chunk metadata, drives the configured concurrent herd through the
legacy full-response route, and samples forced-GC server memory. The provider
adapter, SDK/harness execution, and provider transcript writes remain outside
the worker simulation.

Routine server, browser, and built-client runs do not execute a live provider.
Those servers receive the in-process mock for session launch. Browser drivers
also disable provider discovery so the same harness cannot trigger a real model
probe when measuring an older checkout whose explicit provider override did
not yet own `/api/providers`. This is a post-provider mock boundary and cannot
support claims about provider startup, protocol parsing, transcript production,
or provider teardown.

Before an append write, each page arms a `MutationObserver` for the expected
tail row. Readable text, glossary annotation, and project-path anchors receive
independent `performance.now()` marks at the mutations that make them true.
Playwright waits still enforce the final DOM invariants, but their wake-up time
is not a performance timestamp: `requestAnimationFrame` polling in throttled
headless background pages can otherwise charge an unrelated later WebSocket
event for DOM work that had already completed. Cold and warm navigation retain
their sequential observation semantics in the dev-client driver. Append and
built-client cold milestones are independently marked.

The generated app-data install record seeds the provider catalog families in
`fixture.providerCatalogFamilies`, `claude` by default. This activates the
eligible global provider watcher and external-session summary path while the
provider transcript store remains simulated. A watcher-disabled contrast may
set the list empty, but it changes harness identity and writes to isolated
diagnostic history rather than a normal ratchet history.

Scale points and repetition counts live in `scripts/perf-suite/config.json`.
Targets live in `scripts/perf-suite/ratchets.json`; code contains no scenario-
specific thresholds. Generated work and raw results are local artifacts under
the suite directory and are not committed.

## Host capacity and CI history

Every suite result carries a `host.capacity.capacityKey` derived from platform,
architecture, CPU model, visible and effective CPU counts, cgroup quota/cpuset,
and 256 MiB-bucketed physical and effective memory. Exact capacity fields,
Node/V8 versions, CI runner metadata, and start/end host samples remain beside
the key. Host samples include load averages, host and cgroup-available memory,
swap, Linux pressure-stall data where available, and whole-run CPU occupancy.
Each repetition records the same start/end window so one noisy repetition can
be separated from a stable batch.

A benchmark host does not need to be otherwise idle. Before fixture work, the
suite samples a three-second baseline and checks effective CPU count, idle
logical CPU equivalents, CPU busy fraction, load per effective CPU, effective
available memory (host and cgroup), and swap growth against `config.json`.
Missing CPU or swap measurements are not treated as clean. A failed baseline
makes the completed result diagnostic-grade and prevents a ratchet pass.
Run-window resource and pressure evidence remains recorded for interpretation.
A questionable run is sampling evidence: rerun before expanding the matrix or
changing a baseline.

The portable baseline permits a decaying one-minute load average up to two tasks
per effective CPU and up to 16 MiB of swap growth during its three-second
sample. A stricter load ceiling rejected an otherwise 95%-idle interval because
work completed earlier in the minute; an absolute-zero swap rule rejected a
host with more than 100 GiB of available physical memory because the kernel
moved one stale page. Neither observation showed that the measured process
lacked current CPU or RAM. The contemporaneous CPU-busy, minimum-idle-CPU, and
available-memory gates remain independent. Load or swap growth above these
tolerances remains diagnostic-only. Exact start/end evidence stays in every
result so a machine class can adopt stricter reviewed overrides when its history
supports them.

Capacity-keyed history uses the tuple in `historyKey`: capacity key, driver,
and scenario. Every run appends a compact JSONL record under that tuple.
Historical baselines and tightened machine-specific ratchets must not cross
the boundary. The broad checked-in maxima remain portable safety ceilings.
`ratchets.json.capacityOverrides` registers exact classes and may replace
individual targets while inheriting omitted portable checks. An unseen class
uses the portable target key until its emitted registration is reviewed and
committed; passing there does not establish a same-machine improvement.
Native browser-process byte targets are capacity-specific because operating-
system accounting and process topology are not portable. CDP object-count
ceilings may remain portable when the browser dependency and fixture are
content-addressed with the harness.

For CI collection, the harness emits one-line `YA_PERF_HOST_JSON` before work
and `YA_PERF_HISTORY_JSON`, `YA_PERF_CAPACITY_RATCHET_JSON`, and
`YA_PERF_RESULT_JSON` after writing artifacts. A CI job can scrape those lines,
upload the result and JSONL accumulator, and register a new runner class without
hard-coding its capacity. The complete result remains the evidence source;
committing a capacity registration or tighter target remains a reviewed change.

`.github/workflows/performance.yml` is an explicit manual diagnostic. It does
not run on pushes or pull requests while its GitHub-hosted teardown and portable
runner ceilings are being calibrated; local suite commands remain available.
A maintainer-triggered run executes server and built-client `fleet-small` arms,
a browser `focused-append` arm, and the `specialized-contracts` arm on fresh
runners. Restore automatic triggers only after unchanged-source runs prove that
the workflow is reliably green on its supported runner classes.

Only the browser-capable arms install Chromium. The workflow checks out the
full YA history so the pinned fixture revision is available, and checks out
`graehl/agents` at the reviewed full commit recorded in the workflow. Each arm
uploads its driver/scenario-keyed result, history, and log even on failure and
copies all four scrape records into its step summary. A previously unseen
GitHub runner therefore uses portable ceilings while producing the exact
capacity registration needed for a later reviewed ratchet change.

Small cloud instances are acceptable measurement hosts when their baseline
passes the same scenario-specific eligibility checks. Tag every instance and
run with an owner and run marker, sweep its marked process trees on every exit
path, and destroy temporary instances after artifacts are copied. An instance
that outlives a completed run is resource debris and invalidates the run's
cleanup result.

## Provider-backed measurement tiers

Routine shared-path ratchets should not execute a live provider. When a
provider-backed path is required, prefer a simulated harness process that
implements the provider process boundary: process startup, protocol events,
transcript writes, controls, thinking blocks, and teardown. That level
exercises YA's provider adapter, transcript ingestion, control routing,
subscription behavior, and lifecycle ownership while keeping inputs and timing
deterministic.

A post-provider mock is acceptable when simulating the harness process is not
yet practical. Its result must name the bypassed boundary and must not support
claims about provider startup, protocol parsing, transcript production, or
process cleanup. Before using either mock as a ratchet, compare a small live
sample with the mocked sample and record the provider-execution share and any
event-shape differences. Recalibrate when the provider adapter, model behavior,
or mocked boundary changes materially.

Live provider runs are reserved for that calibration and for behavior that
cannot be reproduced below the provider boundary. Use the provider under test's
lowest-cost model and effort level that still emits thinking blocks; a mode that
omits thinking does not exercise the required event path. Record provider,
model, effort, cost/token facts when available, and host capacity alongside the
result. Start provider-agnostic investigations at the shared YA owner, but label
a conclusion provider-specific or unresolved unless the owning path is shared
or the behavior is reproduced across provider adapters.

The current `specialized` fixture is one intermediate tier: its worker is a
real child process speaking YA's runtime protocol, but it replaces the provider
adapter and SDK/harness rather than impersonating a first-party harness below
that adapter. It therefore supports runtime-host, subscription, enrichment,
ownership, and teardown claims, but not provider parsing or transcript-writer
claims. A future harness-level simulator may move the boundary outward without
changing the public fixture contract. A small live calibration remains required
before interpreting the simulated timing as provider-backed end-to-end timing.

## Background summary telemetry

Maintenance status exposes the external-session summary queue without starting
new work: pending and in-flight counts, deduplication and outcome counters, and
the latest 16 batches with queue, batch, aggregate-task, and maximum-task
durations. Durations use one process-monotonic clock. ISO wall timestamps align
events to a run window only and are never subtracted from browser marks.

The suite snapshots this state around every append window and records counter
deltas plus only batches newer than the opening sequence. Its default simulated
Claude install therefore verifies that summary work happened instead of treating
a watcher-disabled run as evidence about contention. At `large-session-cache`,
three watcher-enabled repetitions queued eight distinct summaries in one batch:
the queue delay was about 300 ms and batch duration 45–62 ms. With mutation-time
DOM marks, append final display was 417 ms uncached and 435 ms cached, versus
466/473 ms in the watcher-disabled contrast. The earlier 967/1,030 ms result
followed background-page observation wake-ups and does not justify changing the
summary schedule.

## 2026-08-08 historical survey

The final comparable survey used three repetitions per non-smoke point on one
host with harness `79fbeeb2d245672a471986c18be26ab580e2dc64` and fixture
`2f5e403e20fc5b96d5634a4b8f5a57704023d8da`. C0 is pre-sprint
`adaa804b`; C1 is pre-measured-arc `3c0f70df`; C2 is end-of-arc `61cb5f35`;
C3 is end-of-harsh-review `d0131298`; C4 is parsed-transcript cache `6024cff1`;
C5 is enrichment-ordering `13d6e794`; surveyed source is `2f5e403e`; profiled
source with forward-looking clocks is `cab8184a`.

At `fleet-small` (4 projects, 6 sessions/project, 12 final turns/session, 4
clients, 8 KiB/message), forced-GC server results were:

| checkpoint | cold project-list p95 | warm project-list p95 | collection p95 | cold readable tail p95 | warm readable tail p95 | appended readable tail p95 | retained heap | settled heap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C0 | 1435 ms | 5 ms | 22 ms | 140 ms | 23 ms | 35 ms | 8.6 MiB | 92.4 MiB |
| C1 | 1471 ms | 5 ms | 16 ms | 141 ms | 22 ms | 32 ms | 15.6 MiB | 99.8 MiB |
| C2 | 1398 ms | 5 ms | 15 ms | 156 ms | 30 ms | 51 ms | 11.3 MiB | 96.1 MiB |
| C3 | 1412 ms | 4 ms | 14 ms | 168 ms | 31 ms | 52 ms | 11.0 MiB | 96.9 MiB |
| C4 | 1396 ms | 4 ms | 16 ms | 168 ms | 26 ms | 47 ms | 20.9 MiB | 106.9 MiB |
| C5 | 1388 ms | 4 ms | 16 ms | 166 ms | 27 ms | 46 ms | 20.8 MiB | 106.9 MiB |
| surveyed | 1439 ms | 4 ms | 14 ms | 177 ms | 29 ms | 51 ms | 20.9 MiB | 106.9 MiB |
| profiled | 1402 ms | 5 ms | 15 ms | 169 ms | 29 ms | 48 ms | 20.9 MiB | 106.9 MiB |

The cold per-project session list is first-index construction. Immediate replay
is 4–5 ms at every checkpoint, so the greater-than-one-second result predates
and survives the arc without affecting the ordinary warm path. Collection-herd
p95 improved from 22 ms at C0 to about 15 ms at the profiled revision.

Session detail did lose ground relative to the C1 floor. At the profiled
revision cold is 28 ms / 20% slower, warm 8 ms / 34% slower, and appended 16 ms
/ 50% slower. C4 partially recovers C3 warm/append latency, but it does not
recover the C1 floor and adds about 9.9 MiB retained heap at this scale. These
are persistent losses behind broad passing limits, not evidence that review
left performance unchanged.

With real browsers at the same scale, file-observed appended final display
crossed the one-second concern threshold at C0 and C1, then improved during the
measured arc and stayed below 421 ms. The surveyed row is the range across two
independent three-repetition batches:

| checkpoint | cache off: warm / append final p95 | 24 MiB cache: warm / append final p95 |
|---|---:|---:|
| C0 | 483 / 1176 ms | 456 / 1201 ms |
| C1 | 588 / 1218 ms | 478 / 1230 ms |
| C2 | 506 / 394 ms | 543 / 401 ms |
| C3 | 766 / 417 ms | 561 / 421 ms |
| C4 | 497 / 406 ms | 498 / 420 ms |
| C5 | 538 / 391 ms | 529 / 391 ms |
| surveyed | 503–504 / 382–396 ms | 525–538 / 387–392 ms |
| profiled | 510 / 391 ms | 518 / 393 ms |

A fresh browser plus dev-client module boot took about 4.2–5.1 seconds at every
checkpoint. That observational number includes Vite transforms, so it is not a
production startup ratchet. Warm in-app navigation and appended final display
are ratcheted.

### Production useful readiness

Three Node 20 current-source `built-client` repetitions at `fleet-small`
measured 1.18–1.25 seconds from production-server process start to selected-
session transcript text and 776–822 ms from cold page navigation to readable
text. At `large-session-cache`, the respective ranges were 1.24–1.26 seconds
and 1.16–1.19 seconds. Portable ceilings are deliberately broader: 2.5/1.5
seconds for fleet server/client readiness and 3/2.5 seconds for large-session
readiness.

The first large-session attempt was invalid. `perf-sweep` found a real Claude
model-probe and plugin-clone process tree after the run, exposing that the old
explicit mock provider controlled session execution but not `/api/providers`.
Current source now routes explicit provider overrides through discovery, and
the browser harness also disables discovery so historical checkouts cannot
cross that live boundary. Clean replacement fleet and large-session batches
produced the ranges above.

### Focused append critical path

Three Node 20 `focused-append` browser repetitions measured 4.4–5.0 ms for the
single selected-session server response and 51–54 ms from file-write submission
to final browser display. File submission through MessageList preprocessing was
21–23 ms; React grouping through commit was 29–30 ms. The host baseline was
19.6% CPU busy with 12.864 idle logical CPUs, 104.7 GiB available RAM, and no
swap growth, and every repetition/final marker sweep was clean.

The portable ceilings are 50 ms for the selected server response and 200 ms
for final browser display, with 100 ms child ceilings on file submission to
preprocessing and grouping to commit. The corresponding `fleet-small` append
still measures deliberate multi-file, multi-page fan-out; its larger result is
not substituted for this critical-path series.

## Cache trade-offs

At `large-session-cache` (2 projects, 4 sessions/project, 16 final
turns/session, 3 clients, 64 KiB/message), forced-GC server results were:

| checkpoint | cold detail p95 | warm detail p95 | appended detail p95 | retained heap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C1 | 272 ms | 123 ms | 169 ms | 11.8 MiB |
| C2 | 526 ms | 260 ms | 329 ms | 9.4 MiB |
| C3 | 308 ms | 157 ms | 204 ms | 9.2 MiB |
| C4 | 324 ms | 149 ms | 208 ms | 41.1 MiB |
| C5 | 325 ms | 155 ms | 214 ms | 41.5 MiB |
| surveyed | 312 ms | 164 ms | 203 ms | 41.5 MiB |
| profiled | 317 ms | 146 ms | 211 ms | 41.2 MiB |

C2 introduced a large transient regression and C3 repaired most of it. The C4
parsed-transcript cache then added 31.8 MiB retained heap relative to C3. It
improved warm detail by 5.4%, while cold worsened 5.2% and append worsened 2.0%.
Relative to the C1 floor, profiled cold, warm, and append are still respectively
16.7%, 18.7%, and 24.4% slower. This supersedes the initial one-session result
that made the cache trade-off look substantially more favorable.

Two independent surveyed-revision browser batches bounded same-SHA variation:

| budget | warm final p95 range | append final p95 range | maximum JS heap range | warm cache |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 MiB | 882–903 ms | 675–685 ms | 124–188 MiB | 0 entries / 0 bytes |
| 24 MiB | 773–798 ms | 682–693 ms | 133–157 MiB | 3 entries / about 14.34 MB |

At the profiled revision, 24 MiB caching improves large-session warm final
return from 896 ms to 780 ms (13%) but changes appended final display from 689
ms to 696 ms. Fleet-scale warm return does not materially improve. Browser heap
is much noisier than forced-GC server heap, so YA's entry/byte accounting is the
cache-specific limit; the heap residual retains a broad independent ratchet.

### Transcript-cache source identity

A retained Claude transcript is a cache hit only when device, inode, ctime,
mtime, and size all match. Incremental parsing is reserved for strict growth
of that same file identity and still verifies the 1 KiB boundary immediately
before the previous parse offset. A changed same-size file, shrink, or replaced
inode receives a full parse, so an atomic provider rewrite cannot extend stale
cached state.

The bounded boundary probe does not prove that an arbitrary writer left every
earlier byte unchanged. A same-inode prefix rewrite followed by growth can
evade it when the final probe still matches. Current provider transcript
writers are treated as append-only; detecting a writer that violates that
contract would require a stronger source revision or full-file hashing before
incremental reuse.

## Current phase ownership

Every profiled sample explains at least 80% of each important total with named,
non-overlapping phases. Historical checkpoints have totals but no retrospective
owner clocks.

| total | smallest recurring 80% owner set | phases individually reaching 10% |
|---|---|---|
| fleet cold detail | augmentation, transcript read, framework/serialization/loopback | the same three |
| fleet warm detail | framework/serialization/loopback, augmentation; read joins in some repetitions | framework/serialization/loopback, augmentation, and sometimes read |
| fleet appended detail | augmentation, framework/serialization/loopback | the same two |
| large cold detail | augmentation, framework/serialization/loopback, transcript read | the same three |
| large warm detail | framework/serialization/loopback, augmentation | the same two |
| large appended detail | framework/serialization/loopback, augmentation | the same two |
| browser warm return | React commit to readable text, state queued to commit; response transfer or navigation residual where needed | commit to readable, state to commit, and large cache-off response transfer |
| browser append | append trigger to preprocess, group to commit | those two; commit to readable is near 10% at fleet scale |

Augmentation consumes normalized persisted messages and project context and
produces Markdown/media/project-path-enriched response messages. Its shared
path index is reused, but Markdown and path traversal reran per returned text
block and request at the profiled revision. Framework/serialization/loopback
carries those response bytes through Hono and the direct WebSocket relay; at the
profiled revision the relay decoded, parsed, wrapped, re-encoded, chunked,
reassembled, and parsed JSON. Browser append trigger-to-preprocess includes file
observation, focused refresh, state merge, and scheduling. The profiled revision
had a fixed 200 ms watcher debounce; current source checks on the leading edge
and keeps the delayed check as validation. React commit-to-readable covers the
rendered transcript projection after state is queued.

The significant phases, cache/invalidation contracts, and recovered seams are
maintained in the sections below. Ratchets cover the current major phase values
without treating nested MessageList spans as additive peers of their
queued-to-commit parent.

### 2026-08-08 augmentation recovery

The first recovery slice detaches the selected response window before any
context-specific HTML, tool, media, or pruning mutation. Claude task state is
still folded over the complete transcript, but only task-bearing messages are
copied before pagination. Persisted Markdown HTML then uses a 32 MiB
source-versioned single-flight cache keyed by exact content and render scope.
Project-path membership supplies the monotonic admission fence; unwatchable or
synchronous-stat fallback answers may coalesce in flight but are not retained.
Inline local images remain outside retained HTML because their file bytes have
no content revision.

A clean same-host `fleet-small` comparison against `a16b6c4a` reduced warm
augmentation p95 from 14.7 ms to 1.3 ms and appended augmentation from 27.1 ms
to 6.1 ms. Warm readable-tail p95 fell from 28.105 ms to 13.244 ms and appended
tail from 46.033 ms to 20.013 ms. Forced-GC retained heap rose from 21.293 MiB
to 23.733 MiB. The cache retained 5,196,384 bytes across 288 entries, with
1,744–1,768 hits and 56–80 joined calls per repetition.

The larger speculative sample retained 17,007,616 Markdown bytes across 128
entries. Warm augmentation was 9.0 ms and appended augmentation 39.2 ms, versus
89.9 ms and 126.1 ms in the historical profiled row. Retained heap was 49.544
MiB versus 41.163 MiB historically. That sample used capacity key
`host-v1-linux-x64-16cpu-126720mib-ecfa1407f7322835`; its 45.4-second window
observed 6% whole-host CPU occupancy, load/effective-CPU at or below 0.049,
at least 121,322,082,304 effective available bytes, and no swap-use change.
This supports the improvement and exposes its bounded memory price without
reclassifying the immutable historical rows.

### 2026-08-08 relay serialization recovery

Valid UTF-8 JSON responses now keep their original body bytes through the
existing `RelayResponse` envelope. The adapter still performs one syntax parse
to enforce the established invalid/empty `body: null` behavior, and it still
buffers a complete response. It no longer serializes the parsed body a second
time. The internal send capability preserves the public message shape and the
existing text/binary, compression, encryption, transport-chunk, sequence, and
pre-auth frame-mode contracts. `Server-Timing` now crosses the relay.

Maintenance and suite output report eligible JSON responses, raw fast-path
hits, preserved body bytes, invalid/unsupported fallbacks, and raw-send
failures. These are fixed-cost process counters. A zero eligible count means a
driver did not exercise this path; compare hit and fallback rates only within
an execution whose eligible count is nonzero.

The focused seven-sample benchmark used a 4,143,404-byte JSON body and alternated
the parsed/re-encoded and validated/raw arms. Median plaintext serialization
fell from 7.96 ms to 3.67 ms (2.17x); gzip-plus-NaCl serialization fell from
21.49 ms to 16.05 ms (1.34x). Capacity key
`host-v1-linux-x64-16cpu-126720mib-ecfa1407f7322835` recorded 12% whole-host CPU
occupancy, maximum load/effective-CPU 0.044, at least 121,307,148,288 effective
available bytes, and no swap-use change during the 0.5-second comparison.
Removing the remaining validation parse would require a separately proven typed
producer boundary; this recovery does not assume one.

### 2026-08-08 focused append observation recovery

The focused `fs.watch` path now requests a stat check immediately and retains
the 200 ms debounced check as trailing validation. Polling remains the fallback.
If a check is already running, one pending check is preserved rather than
dropped, with an observed filesystem event taking priority over a poll. Each
focused change carries a process-monotonic version, observation source and
wall-clock timestamp, emission timestamp, and exact path/mtime/size fact.
Direct global file events carry the same optional fact; fallback rescans and
deletes may omit it.

The client deduplicates only an exact path/mtime/size fact reported through the
broad and focused routes within one second. A missing fact or a repeat from the
same route keeps the existing leading/trailing fetch behavior, preserving a
bounded recovery opportunity. Older servers omit the additive fields and keep
that same pre-deduplication behavior. Browser profiles now split receipt,
request launch, data readiness, state queueing, and MessageList preprocessing
on the browser's `performance.now()` clock. Server wall-clock timestamps are
retained as source facts and are never subtracted from browser marks.

In a final three-repetition `fleet-small` browser run, append-start to
preprocess was 59.3 ms p95 with both zero and 24 MiB transcript-cache budgets,
down from the earlier 261.8–262.2 ms fixed-floor observation. Final display was
187.5 and 188.4 ms p95. The browser-clock path was at most 0.1 ms from receipt
to fetch request, 0.2 ms to request start, 47.1 ms to data readiness, 1.4 ms to
state queueing, and 7.5 ms to preprocess. The capacity-keyed 99.2-second window
used 25.1% whole-host CPU, reached load/effective-CPU 0.293, retained at least
117,738,115,072 effective available bytes, and had no swap-use change. The
earlier three-repetition large-session sample improved append-start to
preprocess from the historical 396–397 ms to 175.9–181.6 ms. Ratchets now cap
this phase at 200 ms for `fleet-small` and 300 ms for
`large-session-cache`.

Smaller append owners remain independent guardrails rather than disappearing
inside that end-to-end ceiling. Server normalization is capped at 2 ms p95,
server route slicing and anchor search at 5 ms for `fleet-small` and 10 ms for
`large-session-cache`, and MessageList preprocessing at 5 ms for both browser
cache budgets and scenarios. These are regression tripwires, not claims that
the current full-array work needs optimization: recent observed p95 values
were 0.1–0.2 ms, 0.6–3.1 ms, and 0.3–0.8 ms respectively.

### 2026-08-08 watcher work bounding

The eligible provider watcher no longer performs synchronous recursive
filesystem work when `fs.watch` omits a filename or periodic reconciliation
fires. Those rescans use asynchronous directory reads and 64-file stat batches,
coalesce overlap into one trailing pass, preserve exact events that arrive
during a scan, and stop publishing when the watcher lifecycle ends. Focused
sessions in one directory now share one native watch, which closes when its
last target leaves; late asynchronous resolution cannot recreate a watch after
unsubscribe.

This recovers the rescan and focused-watch ownership legs of P09 structurally.
The broad activity subscription still forwards every file event to every
subscriber. The remaining defect and its client/server compatibility boundary
are tracked in
[`gaps/global-activity-stream-file-fanout.md`](../gaps/global-activity-stream-file-fanout.md);
server-side filtering is not claimed by this slice.

### 2026-08-08 browser-native memory attribution

The browser driver now records its complete CDP process inventory and, on
Linux, reads RSS, PSS, and private bytes for every PID from `/proc`. Fleet-wide
process totals live in a separate `browserProcessAggregate`; they are not
duplicated under cache budgets. Per-page CDP counters expose live and detached
DOM state that `document.getElementsByTagName("*")` and
`performance.memory` omit. Missing per-PID accounting removes that sample's
total rather than silently undercounting it.

A passing three-repetition Node 20 `fleet-small` run on capacity key
`host-v1-linux-x64-16cpu-126720mib-ecfa1407f7322835` measured 2,807–2,855 MiB
appended browser PSS, including 2,462–2,503 MiB in renderer processes. Median
startup-to-appended PSS growth was 2,774 MiB across 11 Chromium processes.
Cache-off/cache-on maxima were 8,587/9,048 CDP nodes, 7,041/7,084 event
listeners, and 4,934/4,876 layout objects. Capacity-specific ceilings cover
process count, total and renderer PSS, and retained PSS; portable ceilings cover
the CDP object counts. The host baseline showed 16.2% CPU busy, 13.4 idle
logical CPU equivalents, at least 107 GiB available RAM, and no baseline swap
growth. All repetition and final process sweeps were clean.

That identity-complete verification repeated cache-on navigation-to-load-start
at 184–187 ms in two of three clear-host repetitions while complete warm final
display remained about 487 ms. The portable child ceiling therefore moved from
180 to 250 ms, matching the cache-off sibling; the 900 ms user-facing final-
display ceiling is unchanged.

This closes the process-level native-allocation blind spot but does not assign
Blink or renderer bytes to individual YA components. Source-byte cache charges,
JS heap, native process PSS, and CDP object counts remain complementary signals,
not an additive per-component decomposition.

### 2026-08-08 specialized contract baseline

A clear-host three-repetition Node 24 `specialized-contracts` run exercised a
24-chunk, 48 KiB thinking-capable provider stream, a one-second idle deadline,
and eight concurrent frozen-share readers over a 64 KiB/message fixture. The
median-of-repetition aggregate measured 8.4 ms to first text delta, 78.0 ms to
the raw final assistant message, 121.7 ms to its enriched same-id replacement,
and 1.039 seconds from final unsubscribe to ownership release. Frozen-share
metadata took 3.6 ms; readable-text p95 for the eight-client full-response herd
was 85.2 ms, with 13.106 MiB transferred in aggregate. Forced-GC settled heap
was 90.5 MiB and retained heap was 3.7 MiB.

The capacity key was
`host-v1-linux-x64-16cpu-126720mib-ecfa1407f7322835`. Its three-second baseline
was 25.5% CPU busy with 11.920 idle logical CPU equivalents, at least
114,609,823,744 bytes effective available memory, and no swap growth. The
51.2-second run window was 28.6% CPU busy, reached load/effective-CPU 1.016,
retained at least 114,110,087,168 bytes effective available memory, and grew
swap use by 25,952,256 bytes. The available physical memory and idle CPU
headroom remained ample; every repetition and final marker sweep was clean.

Portable ceilings intentionally leave CI margin: 500 ms to first delta, 1.5
seconds to enriched final, 4 seconds to idle release, 250 ms for share metadata,
1.5 seconds for herd readable text, 16 MiB total herd response, 160 MiB settled
heap, and 60 MiB retained heap. Server startup for each fresh leg is capped at
10 seconds. Correct chunk counts and bytes, thinking presence, raw-before-
enriched ordering, frozen/chunk metadata, full-response counts, verified-idle
release, and clean process teardown are hard correctness failures rather than
timing ratchets.

## Ratchet interpretation

The current maximums use broad margins over the three-repetition survey and the
second surveyed-revision browser batch. They are estimated to pass unchanged
code with at least 99.9% probability; this is an engineering estimate, not a
claim based on 1,000 trials. Browser warm and appended final-display targets
remain at or below the one-second user-concern threshold. Independent targets
cover significant server/browser phases, response volume, named cache charges,
heap residuals, transcript entries/bytes, DOM and layout objects, browser-
process PSS on registered capacity, and rendered message rows.

Working-set identity, held-refresh behavior, zero-budget behavior, exact fixture
counts, negative link controls, and the configured browser-cache byte budget
remain hard correctness failures rather than probabilistic thresholds. The
ratchets intentionally do not redefine a historical floor as acceptable merely
because it fits below a broad current maximum.

## Coverage boundary

This family covers static provider-file discovery, public project/session and
collection reads, file-observed live append, glossary artifacts and hints,
automatic generalized bare project-path links where supported, browser
transcript retention, server/browser memory, runtime-hosted simulated provider
streaming, time-compressed verified-idle ownership release, and concurrent
frozen public-share reads. The pinned fixture requires exact positive path
anchors and absent-path, MIME-type, and version-shaped negative controls.
Automatic path linking has no saved enable switch; C0/C1 lack generalized bare-
prose support and C2 onward provide it automatically.

The specialized worker does not execute a real provider adapter, SDK/harness,
or provider transcript writer. Its token-rate metric is deterministic simulated
throughput, not provider execution speed. The one-second reap scenario covers
deadline ownership logic without establishing multi-hour timer stability, and
the local relay keeps public-share storage/routing real while omitting internet
transport. Provider-backed end-to-end timing, adapter-specific parsing,
transcript-write behavior, long-duration timer drift, and remote-relay network
effects still require live calibration or a lower harness-level simulator.
