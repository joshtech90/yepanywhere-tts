Topic: interactives

Status: **proposal, nothing implemented (2026-07-24).** YA's only proxy today
is the Vite dev-client proxy (`createFrontendProxy`,
`packages/server/src/frontend/proxy.ts`); no arbitrary-port proxying and no
project app registry exists. The rich annotator/interview flow originally
drafted here is split out to [[rich-interviews]] — different intent, different
lifecycle, no committed implementation overlap.

## Motivation

The only reason to couple YA with an environment-for-a-web-app panel is
**reach**: the user may be on a tablet or phone over relay, with no knowledge
of how to set such things up. Next to the dev machine, `http://localhost:5199`
already works; from a phone over relay, nothing does — ports, tunnels, TLS,
and auth are exactly the setup a novice cannot do. YA is already the
authenticated, relay-reachable, per-project surface on that machine, so
surfacing the app there is the entire value. YA stays a *container* —
lifecycle, visibility, reach — and never becomes an app framework; the app
itself is independent of the YA codebase, typically customized or built
one-off by the agent in-session for ad-hoc purposes.

Two hard requirements sharpen the scope (maintainer, 2026-07-24): hosting is
**YA-server only** — the app runs from the user's machine through YA's
transports; cloud hosting is right out — and an interactive is **committed
project files**: the scaffolded subdir, registry entry, and per-app guide are
ordinary versioned artifacts in the repo, so an app survives sessions,
travels with a clone, and is reviewable like any other code.

Guiding vision (maintainer, 2026-07-24): "easy enough to use that my kids can
play with it when it is good enough." The bar is a novice — a kid on a
tablet — tapping an icon and playing an agent-built animation or game, not an
operator wiring a deployment. Novice-friendly cuts both ways: *creating* "a
project web app" from a session must be natural for a non-web-dev too, which
is why the convention includes an opinionated app template (below) rather
than leaving each app's organization to per-session improvisation.

Two classes, one registry:

- **Proxied app** — a regular web server (UI or REST) on a loopback dev port
  on the YA machine. YA proxies it; YA does not serve or build it.
- **Served page** — a static rich html+js bundle (no server of its own) that
  YA serves directly from a project path. For the novice vision this is the
  *primary* class: a plain html+js animation or game has no process to keep
  alive, so its icon is always live.

## Vocabulary

- **interactive** (noun) — one registered entry: a proxied app or served page
  affiliated with a project.
- **app icon link** — the persistent per-interactive icon YA renders on the
  project's session surfaces.
- **`INTERACTIVES.md`** — optional project doc whose content overrides the
  default prompt prefix injected by the Create Interactive button. Distinct
  from the machine-readable registry below.
- **app template** — v1: a prefab list of project types plus an inherited
  base project-setup prompt, all plain `.md` prompt documents sent to the
  agent, which builds the intended result; no scaffold engine or template
  config language.
- **per-app agent guide** — the `.md` the scaffold places in an app's subdir
  telling the agent how to develop, update, and run that app; update turns
  reference it.
- **meta-UI protocol** — the template-provided in-app affordance and page↔YA
  channel for commenting to the agent inline from the app view.

## App template and per-app agent guide

"Create a project web app" from a session must be natural for a non-web-dev,
so the convention defines a template for how such an app is organized. The
v1 mechanism is deliberately unstructured: **no config language for project
templates**. Instead:

- a **prefab list of project types** (fixed menu in v1 — e.g. game/animation
  page, dashboard, REST tool; exact list open), and
- an **inherited base project-setup prompt**: plain `.md` prompt documents —
  one base md carrying the common conventions (framework and languages,
  likely TS plus a to-be-chosen minimal framework; directory layout;
  authoring the registry entry; creating the per-app guide; wiring the
  meta-UI hook), with each project type's md adding its specifics on top.

These prompt mds are *sent to the agent*, which builds the intended result by
following them — the agent is the scaffold engine. Toolchain availability is
an operator responsibility, not the convention's: the YA server operator
ensures all YA-launched processes (e.g. the Claude TUI) can see the requisite
node and other resources, so the prompts may assume the toolchain rather than
detect or provision it.

The prompts also instruct the agent to create a **per-app agent guide** — a
`.md` in the created app's subdir that tells the agent how to develop,
update, run, and register that named app. A turn about the app references
that guide (the create/update affordances prefix the composer with the
reference), so "make the ball bounce higher" arrives carrying the app's dev
context and the app stays maintainable across sessions. The prompt mds and
guide are where the agent-facing instructions land — they belong to the
convention, not to YA's server code, which never needs to understand the
framework choice.

**In-project templates (v1, additive).** A project can extend the prefab
menu by dropping prompt mds at a conventional path — proposed
`interactives/templates/<name>.md`, exact path open — which YA discovers and
shows in the create-a-web-app UI alongside the built-in project types. Each
is an ordinary committed prompt document, same mechanism as the prefab type
mds. The proposed path also suggests `interactives/<name>/` as the natural
home for the app subdirs themselves; noted under open decisions.

v1 otherwise ships one opinionated, friendly built-in prompt set: additive
in-project types are v1 because discovery-and-list is cheap, while
*overriding* the built-in base setup prompt per project remains the intended
later extension — recorded here so the v1 shape does not foreclose it,
deliberately not built first.

## Registration standard (the project-local config YA checks)

Proposed: `.yep/interactives.json` at the project root, an array of entries:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "name": "coverage-explorer",       // slug; unique within project
    "title": "Coverage Explorer",      // icon tooltip / label
    "icon": "🧭",                       // emoji or project-relative image path
    "kind": "app",                      // "app" (proxied) | "page" (served)
    "port": 5199,                       // app: loopback port to proxy
    "path": "/",                        // app: landing path
    "bundle": "interactives/coverage-explorer/", // page: served dir
    "start": "pnpm --dir tools/cov dev",// optional managed-lifecycle command
    "healthPath": "/"                   // optional liveness probe
  }
]
```

Contract points:

- YA **reads** this file (watch or rescan on project activity); in v1 YA never
  writes it — the agent authors it when it creates the app. Registry, app
  subdir, and per-app guide are *committed* project files (see Motivation);
  YA applies no exclude machinery — unlike [[attachment-storage]], committing
  is the point here, not a leak risk.
- Proxy targets are **loopback-only** (`127.0.0.1:<port>`); the registry must
  not accept arbitrary hosts. Declaring a port in the project's own config is
  the authorization to proxy it.
- A missing/absent registry means the feature contributes zero UI — the
  convention is self-gating, satisfying [[vanilla-defaults]] without a
  separate toggle. (An off switch for icon rendering still belongs in
  [[session-ui-customization]].)
- Hosted-client gating: advertise a `server-capabilities` string so older
  servers don't get dead icon affordances (see [[server-capabilities]]).

Agreed layout split (2026-07-24): `.yep/` is the home for YA-managed state
(this registry); project-authored content — the app subdirs and in-project
template mds — lives in a visible project tree such as `interactives/`,
curated and committed like any other source.

Schema details (multiple pages per entry, auth annotations, REST-only entries
without a UI landing page) are open; start minimal.

## Visibility contract (app icon links)

- Each registered interactive renders as a persistent icon link, project-
  affiliated: visible on sessions belonging to the declaring project — just
  left of the title in recent-session rows and in the main session view
  header.
- Icon click opens the interactive through YA's transport (new tab or
  embedded view — open decision; embedding interacts with the sandbox
  question under *Security*).
- Liveness: a proxied app whose port is dead renders dimmed (probe =
  `healthPath` or TCP connect), with an affordance to start it when a managed
  `start` command exists. Served pages are always live.
- Hideable via session-UI customization; default-on rendering is acceptable
  only because the project itself opted in by carrying the registry.

## Lifecycle (YA's management role)

YA manages lifecycle/visibility only; it does not own the app's code.

- **v1: observe-only.** Externally started (usually by the agent in-session);
  YA probes liveness, proxies, and renders icons.
- **Later: managed start/stop.** With a `start` command, YA may launch on
  first click and must idle-stop within a bound — an interactive with no
  connected client must not consume server resources indefinitely
  ([[architecture-mandates]]). Managed processes are YA-supervised children,
  reported in the process/status surfaces like other server-owned work.

## Transport and serving

Reach tiers, preferred in order when available:

1. **Direct (LAN/Tailscale)** — the YA proxy route below, behind YA auth.
2. **Cloudflare tunnel** — automatic when tunnel exposure is enabled *and* a
   Cloudflare tunnel capability is discoverable ("present + authed +
   effective"); details below.
3. **Proposed relay fallback** — the existing end-to-end-encrypted relay is a
   transport substrate, but arbitrary interactive asset, navigation, and
   WebSocket forwarding is not implemented. Making a YA-owned URL space work
   over relay is part of this proposal, not an always-available capability.
   Template conventions reduce absolute-origin breakage but do not remove the
   proxy work.

The YA proxy route:

- Shape: `/apps/:projectId/:name/*` on the main server, forwarding HTTP and
  WebSocket upgrades to the registered loopback port. `createFrontendProxy`
  is already a parameterized host/port HTTP+WS raw-socket proxy — generalize
  it rather than adding a proxy dependency.
- The route sits behind YA auth like `/api/*`. Over relay, requests ride the
  E2E channel, so the relay sees ciphertext as usual.
- **Never** reachable from public-share surfaces: public-share relay plaintext
  stays restricted to `GET /public-api/shares/...`
  ([[relay-origin-and-share-gating]]); interactives join speech/STT on the
  must-not-tunnel list.

**Cloudflare tunnel tier** (direction set 2026-07-24, after kzahel suggested
Cloudflare tunnels/ngrok as the standard localhost-exposure tools and an
authenticated Cloudflare CLI as the agent-operable path, like `gh`): prefer
the Cloudflare tool when it is present + authed + effective, over ad hoc
"use relay." Without an effective tunnel, remote reach remains unavailable
until the proposed relay proxy exists. Mechanics:

- Both current CLIs can expose an arbitrary localhost URL. `cloudflared
  tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:<port>` and `wrangler tunnel quick-start
  http://127.0.0.1:<port>` create quick `*.trycloudflare.com` tunnels;
  Wrangler also exposes general `tunnel create`, `list`, and `run` commands.
  Discovery must probe the exact intended command rather than infer capability
  from a binary name. See the official
  [Wrangler tunnel commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/tunnel/)
  and
  [Quick Tunnel constraints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/).
- Auth comes in distinct capability levels and discovery must distinguish
  them: **quick tunnels need no account auth**, but an executable capability
  probe is still required — for example, `cloudflared` Quick Tunnels are not
  supported when a `.cloudflared/config.yaml` file is present. A
  **named-tunnel run token** (dashboard-managed; no local `cert.pem`) can
  only run its one tunnel, not create tunnels or hostname routes; **origin
  cert or API auth** is what permits creating named tunnels and routing
  hostnames. An operator already running a dashboard-managed named tunnel
  (e.g. for a relay server) proves the account and could add interactive
  hostnames to that tunnel via dashboard/API, but the host's run token alone
  cannot.
- Tunnel processes are YA-managed children under the [[architecture-mandates]]
  idle bounds, like managed app starts.
- Trust posture: a tunnel URL reaches the app **without YA auth** — a quick
  tunnel is a public bearer URL; a named tunnel can add Cloudflare Access.
  That is partly the point (a kid or guest opens the game with no YA login)
  and a deliberate exposure change: enabling tunnels is an explicit setting,
  default off ([[vanilla-defaults]]), and an icon whose app is
  tunnel-exposed should show it.
- Consistency with the hard requirement: a tunnel is *transport to the YA
  machine*, not cloud hosting — the app and its files stay local and
  committed. "Cloud is right out" rejects hosting, not a tunnel.

**Live loop, not deploy-on-push.** The container is deliberately more
intuitive and interactive than see-the-effect-only-on-push flows (pre-push
hooks that build and deploy a website, Pages-style deploys): the app runs
live on the YA machine and iteration is immediate for both agent and user. A
push-deployed public/prod side remains a nice optional extension when a
project defines one — a matured interactive graduating to a real deploy
target — and is out of v1 scope.

## Security

The trust boundary ([[security]]) permits the *reach*: local and authenticated
remote operators already command agents with full host power, so proxying a
loopback port to them adds no new principal. The crux is different — **ambient
authority under YA's origin**. YA auth is an httpOnly `yep-anywhere-session`
cookie (`packages/server/src/auth/routes.ts`), so interactive JS cannot read
the credential, but anything served/proxied under the YA origin can *make*
authenticated same-origin `/api/*` requests as the operator — CSRF-equivalent
full API power for agent-generated (LLM-authored, lightly reviewed) code. The
kid-playable vision hardens this from concern to requirement: a child tapping
a game icon must not be one script call away from operator API power, so
isolation is the default posture, not an option.

Direction, to verify at design time: render interactives in a sandboxed iframe
without `allow-same-origin`, giving the page an opaque origin — SameSite=Lax
should then withhold the session cookie from its requests <!-- assumed -->.
Path-only separation (`/apps/...` with CSP) does **not** isolate origin and is
insufficient alone. If sandboxing proves incompatible with useful apps (e.g.
they need their own workers/storage), the fallback posture is informed
consent: opening an interactive is running agent-authored code with operator
power, stated plainly — acceptable for the operator, not for the kid case.

The meta-UI protocol (below) reinforces this posture: a templated app's only
channel to YA is a brokered message channel, so it needs no ambient authority
at all.

Hosted-client wrinkle: on `ya.graehl.org` the client reaches the server
through the relay tunnel, not direct HTTP, so an iframe `src` has no plain URL
to point at; serving the interactive's assets to the hosted client needs a
tunnel-backed URL space (service-worker-mediated fetch or blob/`srcdoc`
injection). The general form of this: a *standard* unmodified web app can in
theory be carried over relay as long as its view/URL is a YA-server one —
every fetch, asset URL, and WebSocket the app makes must resolve inside the
YA-owned URL space so the proxy machinery can carry it over the E2E channel;
absolute-origin assumptions break it. That is significant machinery for
arbitrary apps, and another argument for the template: the base prompt md
mandates relay-compatible conventions (relative URLs, no hardcoded origins,
WS via the served path). Direct (Tailscale/LAN) mode has no such problem,
and a Cloudflare tunnel sidesteps it entirely by giving the app a real
public origin.

## Meta-UI protocol (comment-to-agent from the app view)

The template bakes a meta-UI affordance into every scaffolded app: from the
running app's view, the user can comment inline to the agent — a small
overlay/widget, not something each app reinvents. Mechanically it is a
page↔YA channel: under the sandboxed-iframe posture, `postMessage` brokered
by the embedding YA client is the natural transport, and it doubles as the
*only* capability an app is granted — comments need no cookie or `/api/*`
authority. A comment (plus optional app-supplied context such as the tapped
element or app state) lands in the session composer for the user to send
(v1; auto-send is a later opt-in), consistent with [[vanilla-defaults]].
This is the freeform, app-side sibling of [[rich-interviews]]: the same
input-back-to-agent direction, but unstructured in-app comments rather than
structured multi-round forms.

## Create Interactive button

A composer-adjacent action whose type chooser lists the prefab project types
plus any in-project templates, then prefills the composer with the base
project-setup prompt and the chosen type's prompt (or references to
them), so the agent builds the app to the convention. An update affordance
on an existing app similarly prefixes a reference to that app's per-app
agent guide. The default create prefix is built-in; a
project overrides it by carrying `INTERACTIVES.md`, whose content precedes the
user's turn in the composer. Because the prefix lands *in the composer* —
visible, editable, sent verbatim only when the user sends — it is an
explicitly invoked transform in [[vanilla-defaults]] terms, like emulated
slash-command expansion. This button is the piece that serves the novice
vision most directly (tap → describe the game you want), and also the first
piece to cut if the container concept shrinks — it is sugar, not structure.
The agent-facing instructions/skills that make the build reliable are TBD and
belong beside the standard once it stabilizes.

## Relation to rich interviews

[[rich-interviews]] (the annotator/interview flow) was originally drafted as a
section here and is deliberately separate: its intent is routine structured
input consumed by workflows/skills, its lifecycle is issued-into-a-session
rather than project-persistent, and its likely v1 (YA-rendered declarative
forms) shares no implementation with this container. The one seam: if an
interview ever needs arbitrary DOM expressiveness, it may embed an
interactive — a directional reference, not shared ownership. As of
2026-07-24 rich interviews are banked entirely (lower incremental value);
the working bet is that this container's machinery — template, meta-UI
protocol, embedding — accumulates until the interview use cases become
easily buildable on top.

## Prior art

Learn-from targets — source code, demos, marketing — from a 2026-07 survey
pass. Study their interaction patterns and bridge protocols; their cloud
hosting models are explicitly rejected by the YA-server-only requirement:

- **GitHub Spark** — natural-language micro-apps ("sparks") on an opinionated
  managed runtime (storage, theming, LLM access) with a PWA dashboard for
  launching them from anywhere, hosted behind GitHub auth. Validates the
  shape — template + registry + icon dashboard + zero-setup reach — while its
  Azure hosting is exactly what the requirement rejects: the shape transfers,
  the hosting model does not.
  (https://github.com/features/spark,
  https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark/)
- **Lovable "Visual Edits" / preview toolbar** (similarly v0, Bolt.new) —
  select elements in the running preview, describe the change in plain
  language, send to the agent to iterate; selected elements attach to the
  chat input as references. The meta-UI protocol is this pattern generalized
  to template-scaffolded apps, and the composer-landing v1 matches the
  attach-to-chat-input behavior.
  (https://docs.lovable.dev/features/preview-toolbar)
- **MCP Apps standard / ChatGPT Apps SDK** — embedded app UIs run in a
  sandboxed iframe (ChatGPT: a dedicated `*.web-sandbox.oaiusercontent.com`
  origin with per-widget CSP) and talk to the host via `ui/*` JSON-RPC over
  `postMessage` (`window.openai` wraps it). Directly validates the
  sandbox-plus-brokered-channel posture; evaluate MCP Apps as the meta-UI
  message schema before defining a YA-private one.
  (https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/build/chatgpt-ui,
  https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/mcp-apps-in-chatgpt)
- **Claude Artifacts** — agent-built single-page apps rendered in a sandboxed
  iframe beside the chat; precedent for the served-page class and for tight
  default sandboxing of agent-authored code. <!-- assumed; not re-verified in
  this survey pass -->

None of them cover YA's actual coupling reason: the app living on the user's
own dev machine inside a project checkout as committed files, reached over
the operator's authenticated relay rather than vendor hosting.

## Open decisions

- Registry filename within `.yep/` (the `.yep/` home for YA-managed state is
  agreed 2026-07-24) and minimal v1 schema.
- The v1 prefab project-type list, and the framework/language choices and
  layout conventions the base prompt md pins down (including where app
  subdirs live, served-page vs proxied-app cases — `interactives/<name>/`
  if aligned with the in-project templates path).
- The in-project templates path (`interactives/templates/<name>.md` proposed)
  and how template titles/descriptions surface in the create-UI menu.
- Per-app agent guide filename and required sections.
- Whether served-page bundles commit built output (servable from a fresh
  clone with no build step) or commit source only and rebuild on update
  (toolchain presence is an operator guarantee either way).
- Meta-UI channel mechanics (message schema, context payload, composer
  delivery vs queued turn; a fallback channel for new-tab opens where no
  embedding parent exists).
- Embed vs new-tab open; sandbox mechanism verification (opaque-origin cookie
  behavior across target browsers).
- Hosted-client (relay) asset serving for embedded interactives.
- Managed-lifecycle idle-stop bound and its status surface.
- Tunnel exposure scope and UI (global setting vs per-interactive; quick vs
  named tunnels; Cloudflare Access policy for non-public apps; the
  "present + authed + effective" discovery test across the auth capability
  levels above; tunnel-child idle bound).
- Optional push-deployed public/prod side for a matured interactive, when a
  project defines a deploy target.
- Whether REST-kind entries get a YA-rendered landing (request console) or
  just a link.
