# Backward compatibility decisions

Durable decisions for observable or persisted surfaces whose compatibility
handling is not obvious from the implementation alone.

Topic: backward-compat

## Decisions

2026-06-23 `session-metadata.json` — add optional transcript display objects in
schema version 2 while retaining all version-1 session metadata; the additive
migration preserves existing configured state, and interrupted generating
objects recover as errors because their in-memory jobs cannot survive restart.

2026-06-24 `PI_PATH` — rename the pi provider executable override to
`PI_EXECUTABLE` because the value is a full binary path, not a search directory;
keep `PI_PATH` as a startup-normalized legacy alias so existing launches still
resolve the same executable.

2026-07-03 `hasUnread` (REST session rows/detail) — compute unread from the
pre-recap-overlay `updatedAt` instead of the overlaid one, so a recap landing
never flips a fully-seen session unread; reverses the overlaid-freshness
choice in "Tighten recap overlay cursor and freshness handling" because a
YA-synthesized recap is derived viewer content, not new provider activity.

2026-07-04 `clientDefaults.sessionToolbarVisibility` /
`clientDefaults.sessionToolbarPriority` — replaced by a single
`clientDefaults.sessionToolbarPresence` map (`hidden` | narrowing tier) per
explicit direction that the toolbar data model carry no separate visibility
boolean; hiding forgets the prior tier. Stored state is folded in at load on
both sides (`ServerSettingsService.mergeLoadedClientDefaults`; client
localStorage migration in `useSessionToolbarPresence`), but the settings
PUT surface no longer accepts the legacy keys: a stale cached client sending
them gets 400 and logs a console warning until it picks up the new bundle.
Accept-and-translate was deliberately skipped as speculative scaffolding for
a transient skew.

2026-07-05 session-detail REST default / approval audit log — uncursored
`GET /api/projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId` now returns a
two-compaction tail unless `fullHistory=1` is explicit, and approval decision
logging now defaults off behind `approvalAuditLogEnabled`. The session-detail
flip is the server-side safety backstop for tactical 055/SPC-007: the current
client source API requires a bound or explicit full-history request and handles
pagination, while stale cached or out-of-repo clients that relied on the old
unbounded default now get a bounded window and must opt in to full history.
The audit-log flip favors privacy/explicit operator intent over implicit
security logging; older clients cannot enable it without the capability-gated
settings surface.

2026-07-10 session-detail turn selectors — `tailTurns` and `tailFrom` narrow
the default or explicitly requested compact-tail scope; they do not replace it.
Only `fullHistory=1` authorizes those selectors to reach across older compact
boundaries. This closes a regression where the client's implicit
`tailTurns=20` safety cap disabled the two-compaction REST default and could
return a full Codex transcript with fewer than twenty user turns.

2026-07-20 process-abort `resumeExemption` response — replace the
`rolloutsRenamed` / `failures` fields with `autoResumeDisabled` / `error` and
stop renaming provider rollout files; the short-lived former contract made an
explicit Kill hide history and prevent deliberate continuation, so preserving
that response shape would preserve the wrong mechanism. YA's co-deployed
client now distinguishes verified shutdown from exemption persistence failure.

2026-07-23 Pi RPC turn completion — use `agent_settled` for Pi 0.80.4 and
newer, but retain `agent_end` for version-probed 0.79.9 through 0.80.3
binaries because they never emit the newer event and would otherwise hang.
Fail startup when `pi --version` is unrecognized rather than guessing a
boundary that could either hang or finalize before retry/compaction completes.
