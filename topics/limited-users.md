# Limited users

> Proposal: a second class of YA principal — a named limited user beside the
> single superuser — who logs in with their own credential (a username
> carried as the SRP identity over the existing relay claim, or standard
> HTTP auth on direct access), sees and
> acts on only the projects they own or are listed on, creates new projects
> only from templates, and whose sessions always run sandboxed; project

> superuser or the project owner.

Topic: limited-users

Status: **v1 delivered (2026-09-20); the rest remains proposal.** See
§ Delivery v1 — Settings → Users for the committed contract.

The superuser can configure shared append/replace instruction blocks and
per-user appended blocks in Settings → Users. The implemented ordering,
defaults, provider mapping, relaunch timing and compatibility contract live
under [limited-user instructions](session-sandboxing.md#limited-user-instructions).
Every sandboxed Claude-family session also disables MCP servers and connectors,
independently of that editable prompt text.

The implemented template-creation extension is specified in
[project templates](project-templates.md#limited-user-permissions): server-enforced
None / Selected / Any permissions in Settings → Users. A configured creation
root defaults to Any, otherwise None (user-directed 2026-09-28); existing
records migrate once, retaining later explicit administrator choices. Creation
uses project-confined setup and the existing locked session launch policy. The
[stand-up gap](../gaps/project-template-standup.md) tracks the remaining App,
workspace, identity and recovery integration.

Settings hidden from limited users inherit the superuser's effective server
configuration; hiding a control does not select a separate default. Explicit
per-user grants and locks remain authoritative. Optional personal controls to
turn off part of an allowed feature set are only a
[sketch](../gaps/sketches/limited-user-preference-narrowing.md), not implemented
preferences or an additional source of authority.

The implemented **Allow public apps** permission defaults off for new and
existing limited users. It supplies the publication ceiling for their app
addresses; the server rechecks it for row updates and incoming requests.
The earlier **Private apps only** proposal describes the inverse of this
permission. Creation-time template publication remains in the stand-up gap.

### Approved workspace direction (2026-09-21; not implemented)

New limited users default their **Create in** directory to `~/username`,
editable by the superuser. This same directory is their default writable
session sandbox, allowing an agent to work across that user's own projects.
The superuser locks one of two modes in Settings → Users; a limited user does
not choose sandbox granularity in New Session:

- **Personal directory:** sessions can write within Create in, allowing work
  across that user's projects; paths outside it remain read-only.
- **Current project only:** sessions can write only to their active project,
  preventing cross-project writes even among their own projects. An explicit
  new-session grant also permits a session confined to a project outside Create
  in. In this mode the active project's writable root is not intersected with
  the personal directory. Other projects remain read-only.

Creation permission is independent: a user can be allowed to create projects
while locked to Current project only. A view/join grant is not a new-session
grant; entering an already-running session must not bypass its principal or
write-scope enforcement. Limited users never select an unsandboxed state.
Approved migration (user-directed 2026-09-23): apply the new defaults to existing
limited users too. Set Personal directory scope and Selected App canvas,
Storybook and Web page; fill an absent Create in root with `~/username`,
preserving a configured custom root and unrelated grants/provider locks.
Apply once; later administrator choices survive
restarts. Existing running sessions keep their established sandbox until
relaunched; migration does not broaden live provider mounts.

Other host files remain readable under the existing filesystem sandbox
contract. For the household use case, siblings can be consulted from an agent
session; writes require the applicable mode and explicit new-session grant.
This is write confinement,
not a new confidentiality claim. YA project visibility and view/join/new-session
grants remain separate: a personal directory is not an API grant to every
project. Only the Current project only mode uses an explicitly granted external
project as its writable boundary.

Settings → Users keeps account/password, provider/model/effort locks, join
freshness and project grants together with the new Workspace & sandbox and
New projects sections. The template allowlist can deny creation without
removing the personal sandbox. The default write scope is Personal directory;
Current project only is a superuser-managed alternative, not a child-facing
per-session choice. Missing or invalid
workspace roots must not fall back to an unsandboxed launch or all of home.
See the [integration gap](../gaps/project-template-standup.md) for launch,
join/resume and filesystem enforcement checks before this becomes runtime.

Read as a local-credential and policy profile over the shared concepts
sketched in [[principals-and-grants]], not a separate approved authorization
architecture. That shared sketch is itself a proposal: it does not require a
hosted service or select a protocol. Relate any later slice to that broader
model and record the deliberately local seams; v1's are its own SRP identity
selection and its superuser-managed grant lists.

The background below was written against `684687c69` and describes the
pre-v1 state:

- One account, no usernames. `AuthService` holds a single bcrypt password
  hash and cookie sessions keyed by verifier; `verifyPassword` takes only a
  password. [[security]] states YA has no roles, no project access-control
  lists, and no operator/viewer split, and that a restricted multiuser layer
  "requires new principals, server-side authorization, and an enforced
  execution boundary".
- Direct access accepts a cookie session, a desktop cookie or token, or,
  when auth is disabled and localhost-open is on, everyone reaching the
  listener (`middleware/auth.ts`). There is no HTTP Basic or Bearer auth for
  the API.
- The relay reserves one **server name** per install: `server_register`
  with `username` and `installId`, first-come-first-served, reclaimable by
  the same install id, expiring after inactivity (`relay-protocol.ts`,
  `packages/relay/src/registry.ts`). That name is also the SRP identity. The
  relay has no account or user concept beyond that claim.
- Settings have three scopes: browser-local, source-scoped client storage,
  server-wide ([[settings-ui-placement]]). No server-side per-user partition.
  Browser profiles ([[browser-profile-devices]]) are device identities with no
  authority.
- Session sandboxing is implemented on Linux ([[session-sandboxing]]) and
  requires enforced authentication, but is documented as not a hostile
  multi-tenant boundary.
- Sub-operator authority exists only as bearer links: public shares
  ([[relay-origin-and-share-gating]]) and app links
  ([[active-content-security]] § Private app links).

## The idea in brief

The **superuser** is what a YA login is today: full ownership of every
project, setting, and session. When authentication is disabled, every
localhost browser is the superuser, exactly as now. A **limited user** is a
new named principal the superuser creates. Logged in, they see the same YA UI
but scoped: their own projects, the projects where they are listed as an
editor, New Project from template, and nothing else. Every session a limited
user starts runs sandboxed; the toggle is not theirs to clear. The superuser
keeps full access to everything, including limited users' projects, and
manages a per-project **members** list.

Motivating case: the household or small-team host. One machine runs YA; the
owner wants a child, a partner, or a collaborator to make and play with their
own template-born projects ([[project-templates]]) over the same relay,
without handing them the operator credential that can reach every project on
disk.

## Delivery v1 — Settings → Users

**v1** is the named, committed subset of this proposal. It replaces the
phase list below as the first thing actually built; the later phases remain
proposal. Everything in this section is a contract: an externally testable
outcome, enforced server-side at the operation, not by hiding a control.

**v1 scope in one line.** A superuser-managed set of limited users, each with
three per-project grants, an optional provider/model/effort lock, a
join-freshness offset, an optional project-creation directory, and
attributed usage; a **Settings → Users** page that creates them, edits
them, switches into them for testing, and logs out; relay login as a limited
user; and default-deny authorization for every API operation a limited user
makes.

**Feature gate.** `limitedUsersEnabled` in server settings, default off
([[vanilla-defaults]]). Off means no principal other than the superuser and
no limited-user login; turning it off while limited users exist keeps the
records but refuses their logins. That includes logins already signed in: a
live limited cookie, relay, or websocket login answers 401 and its
subscriptions are refused, never falling back to superuser authority. Their
unexpired sessions act again if the feature is turned back on. Settings →
Users stays reachable either
way, because it is where the switch and the first user both live.

### v1 user record

`limited-users.json` in the data directory, one record per username:

- `username` — the relay label grammar, 3–32 characters of lowercase
  letters, digits, and hyphens, first and last alphanumeric. Unique.
- `passwordHash` — bcrypt, for the direct cookie login.
- `srp` — `{ salt, verifier }` generated from the same password with the
  username as SRP identity, so the relay path verifies without a second
  credential. Changing the password rewrites both forms; neither form is
  ever returned by an API. It also ends every login the user holds: their
  direct cookie sessions, and their relay sessions, whose saved resume
  credentials stop working. Deleting the user ends them too, and a new user
  starts with none, even one reusing a deleted user's name. A connection
  already open keeps acting until it reconnects; disabling the user refuses
  it at once.
- `newSessionProjects: string[]` — projects where the user may start
  sessions. Every session they start is forced to `sandboxLevel:
  "project-write"` with its network firewall on; the request cannot select
  `none`, and a request that sets `sandboxNetworkFirewall: false` is refused.
- `joinProjects: string[]` — projects where the user may act in a
  **fresh**, **sandboxed** existing session started by anyone: send and
  shape turns, attach files, answer and approve tool requests, interrupt,
  and change its permission mode. That is the authority of the session's
  process, so it is granted only where that process runs in the
  project-write sandbox; a session running outside it stays read-only for
  the user, whoever started it.
- `viewProjects: string[]` — projects whose sessions the user may read.
- `joinStaleOffsetMinutes` — −5 to +60, default 0 (see freshness below).
- `lock: { provider?, model?, effort? }` — any subset; an absent field is
  not locked.
- `disabled?`, `createdAt`, `lastLoginAt?`.

Grants are a union, not a hierarchy: `newSessionProjects` and
`joinProjects` each imply view on their own projects, so `viewProjects`
only needs the read-only extras.

### Freshness

A session is fresh for a limited user while
`now − lastActivity ≤ providerCacheWarmMinutes + joinStaleOffsetMinutes`.
`lastActivity` is the running process's last provider message; before the
process has seen one (a session just resumed) and for a session with no
process, it is the session catalog's last-update time. A session with
neither is not fresh.
`providerCacheWarmMinutes` is a believed prompt-cache-warm window per
provider, shipped as **60 for Claude-family providers and 10 for everything
else, Codex included** — the same zero point the stale-session cutoff above
describes.

The cutoff **always applies** to a limited user (user-directed 2026-09-28):
to sessions they started themselves exactly as to anyone else's, whether the
session still has a live process or must be resumed, and whatever grants
they hold. It gates every request that makes the provider answer on the
session's existing context — a turn (`messages`), an answer or approval
that continues one (`input`, `approve`, `approvals`), a queued or steered
deferred message (`queue`, `POST deferred/…/steer`), and `resume` — and a
Project Queue existing-session item, judged at dispatch. Actions that start
no provider work stay open on a cold session: reading, marking seen,
interrupting, changing the permission mode, uploading, opening its sandbox
apps and artifact previews, dropping a deferred message, and reactivating a
process without a turn. A refused request answers 403 with reason
`stale-session`; a refused Project Queue item fails, saying the session has
gone cold.

**Redirect into a new session.** Where the user holds `newSessionProjects`
on the session's project, the refusal also carries
`staleRedirect: "stale-handoff"`, and the client resends the same message
to `POST …/sessions/:id/stale-handoff`. That starts a **new session** in the
same project whose first turn is a YA-generated handoff of the old one — the
bounded transcript the manual Handoff builds, with its Source Session block
— introduced as context for a message that **may be a new, independent
request**, followed by the user's message under **New Message**. That
framing is specific to this redirect; the manual Handoff keeps its own. The
new session is the user's own, launched under the same policy as session
create (sandbox and firewall forced, the lock applied, this host only),
otherwise inheriting the old session's provider, model and effort. The old
session is left exactly as it was: not compacted, interrupted, or resumed,
since each would spend the cold context this exists to avoid. The client
then opens the new session. With only a join grant there is no redirect:
the session is read-only for that user, with the reason stated. The
composer does not yet say before sending that a message will start a new
session.

### Approved project removal retention

User-directed, 2026-09-28; **personal removal, retained audit storage and
administrator restore in project App Settings implemented**. A limited user's project
delete action only removes the project from that user's view. Label it
**Remove from my projects** and explain that files and history remain. Store
the personal hidden marker and an actor/time audit event in YA app data.
Project lists and selectors honor it across reconnects and restarts; it does
not revoke grants or erase the canonical project, sessions, ownership or
audit records. The superuser retains visibility, including who removed it
and when, and can restore it with a recorded action. Do not implicitly stop
its app or release a reserved hostname. The `personal-project-hiding`
capability guarantees these removal semantics; older servers retain their
existing removal label and confirmation. Administrator restoration also
invalidates connected project lists.
The [project service contract](project-service.md) and existing
[template integration gap](../gaps/project-template-standup.md) track this
auditability requirement together with project App access.

### Project sharing

User-directed, 2026-09-28. A project's settings (the Projects gear) carry
**Share with limited users** for the superuser and for the limited user who
created the project, recorded as its `ownerUsername`. Each other limited
user is listed with a per-project level, any level including Start
sessions, saved as it is chosen; a covering directory grant is shown beside
it, since this panel cannot remove one. It edits the same per-project grants
as Settings → Users, where the superuser reviews and revokes them. The
routes are `GET`/`PUT /api/projects/:projectId/access` under the
`project-access-sharing` capability. A limited user who did not create the
project gets 403 there; the creator's own access is not offered.

### Project copy

User-directed, 2026-09-28. Anyone who can see a project, View sessions
included, may make their own copy: `POST /api/projects/:projectId/copy`
with a directory name (`project-copy` capability). A limited user's copy
lands under their configured project directory (none configured: 403); the
superuser's beside the source. The destination is claimed exclusively,
checked on disk against the project directory, and filled with the source's
working tree minus `node_modules`, symbolic links (which could name any host
file) and special files, bounded at 512 MB and 50,000 entries; a failed or
oversized copy removes what it made. The response names the new directory,
which the client adds through the ordinary add-project route, so the copy is
owned and granted Start sessions like any project the user adds.

### Authorization

**No project sessions.** A per-user `allowNoProjectSessions` checkbox defaults
off. When enabled, both detached creation routes launch in a stable private
scratch workspace for that username, with the usual sandbox, network firewall,
provider/model/effort locks, creator attribution and limited-user instructions.
This creates no grant on the superuser's shared No project workspace or another
user's private one. Private workspaces remain hidden from Projects and named
No project in session lists. Disabling creation retains read/join access to
existing private sessions; it does not admit new sessions in that workspace.
The `limited-user-no-project-sessions` capability gates the checkbox, submitted
field and limited-user detached option. Without it, omit the field and deny
detached creation in the client. Supported v0.9.0–v0.9.2 lack this contract;
the capability and fallback were approved on 2026-09-28.

**App distribution.** Per-user `allowPublicApps` defaults false;
`allowPrivateAppLinks` defaults true. These are independent of project view
and Start sessions grants. [Project service](project-service.md#app-address-in-project-settings)
owns publication, owner ceilings, inline links and revocation behavior.

The File Viewer's public-link dialog also permits file addresses when the user
has Allow public apps and Start sessions access to the selected project.
The address routes check that supplied project themselves, limit inventory
to the caller's own rows, and enforce persisted creator ownership for replacement
and release. All served files, including linked files and symlink targets, stay
inside that project's canonical root. The administrator-only public-file-share
inventory stays hidden and unrequested. Incoming address requests recheck the
creator's current account and grants. See
[file vhosts](active-content-security.md#file-vhosts) for the exact contract.

Enforcement is a single server-side middleware ahead of every API route, so
a route added later is refused for limited users until it is listed. It is
**default-deny**: a request path a limited principal is not explicitly
allowed gets 403, and a project or session outside the user's grants gets
404 (existence is not disclosed).

**Directory grants** (`pathGrants`, user-directed 2026-09-28) give one access
level to every project at or beneath a directory, including projects created
there later; the editor fills one from a limited user's project directory
by username. The server stores each path resolved (`~` expanded, `..`
collapsed) and refuses a relative one. A project's level is the higher of
its per-project grant and any covering directory grant, judged on the path
its id encodes. Surfaces that list a user's projects instead of asking
about one see the grants with every known covered project (added projects
plus the last scan) written into the per-project lists.

The decision is made on the path the router dispatches, after
percent-decoding, so an encoded spelling such as `/api/%69ssues` is judged
as the `/api/issues` route it reaches. A project grant comes only from a
project or session id in that path: a `projectId` query parameter opens
nothing, since most routes ignore one. The explicitly allowed file-address
routes are the exception: they validate the supplied project and creator at
the route before reading or changing mappings. An id segment that is not valid
percent-encoding is refused.

| operation | limited user |
|---|---|
| any API path not on the v1 allowlist | 403 |
| `GET` of a project-scoped path | allowed when the project is in any of the three lists, else 404 |
| rename, caption, or code name | only a project the user owns, which also needs its `newSessionProjects` grant, else 403: these are one value every principal sees, so a grant to start sessions in someone else's project is no say in how it is presented. For every principal, an id naming no listed project is 404 and nothing is stored |
| remove a project | owner and `newSessionProjects` checks still apply; persist a personal hidden marker and audit event instead of hiding the canonical project. List projections omit it for that user, while direct access follows unchanged grants. Superuser removal retains its existing global-hide meaning |
| session create in a project | `newSessionProjects` only; sandbox forced, with its network firewall on when the request names none; a request with `sandboxNetworkFirewall: false` 403, stating that the firewall stays on; lock applied; a remote executor or computer control is refused |
| resume or reactivate a session | `newSessionProjects` on its project; the session must already run sandboxed with its network firewall on, and on this host, else 403; the lock applies as at create, replacing the session's model and effort with locked ones. A resume carries a turn, so it must also be fresh, else 403 with reason `stale-session` ([Freshness](#freshness)) |
| redirect a cold session's turn (`stale-handoff`) | `newSessionProjects` on its project; starts a new session under the create rule, seeded with a handoff of this one ([Freshness](#freshness)) |
| fork or clone a session | `newSessionProjects` on its project; the copy is recorded as the user's own; running it is a resume, under the row above |
| any other session action that starts a provider process (restart, recap, retitle, fork-after-summary, rewind, clearloop, resuming or steering a restart-paused queued message, session bang commands) and moving a session to another project | 403: only listed session actions are open, and each listed one that launches applies this launch policy |
| turn/approval/interrupt/permission-mode change on a session | the session's project in `newSessionProjects` or `joinProjects`, **and** the session runs sandboxed with its network firewall on (its live process enforces both, or with no process its last launch recorded both), else 403 with reason `unsandboxed-session`, **and**, for a request that starts provider work (a turn, an answer or approval, a delivered deferred message), it is fresh — whoever started it — else 403 with reason `stale-session` ([Freshness](#freshness)) |
| any session the user started | always at least readable, including after its project grant is removed |
| Issues & PRs (`/api/issues*`) | 403, and the nav entry is hidden: it spends the host's ticket-system credentials |
| provider sign-in (`/api/providers/:name/login*`) | 403, including the status read: a live device code would sign the host's CLI into whichever account enters it ([Provider sign-in](provider-sign-in.md)) |
| Inbox, Projects, Source Control, All Sessions | served, with every project and session outside the user's grants removed before pagination; All Sessions project options and aggregate statistics use the same scope |
| Project Queue | global list and promote-now responses include only ordinary items, recovered items and project statuses (including blocker session titles) in granted projects; the route builds them from the user's grants so other projects' entries are never read for them, and a response-field allowlist backs that up. The global dispatch pause remains visible because it gates the user's own items. Promote-now needs `newSessionProjects` on the project in its path; pausing or resuming dispatch 403 |
| Project Queue items | queuing needs `newSessionProjects`; a new-session target is held to the create rule (sandbox and its firewall forced, a firewall opt-out refused, lock applied, remote executor refused) and an existing-session target may name neither a remote executor nor a value outside the lock; a queued YA command 403. The item records the user, who alone may edit, retry, reorder, or delete it (404 otherwise). At dispatch their grants are read again: without `newSessionProjects` the item fails, an existing-session target must run sandboxed with its firewall on and be in the item's project or one they started, and the turn and any new session are attributed to them. Staged attachments are taken only from their own draft store and stay in it through restart, dispatch and cleanup; a reference from another account's store is refused (400), and a superuser edit of their item cannot add the superuser's drafts to it ([Project Queue § Attachments](project-queue.md#attachments)) |
| settings | `GET /api/settings` only, answered with a projection holding the fields their client reads to render and default their own work; secrets and host inventory (webhook URL and token, remote executors, gateway and Ollama endpoints and start commands, file-access rules, the readiness command, global instructions) are withheld, and a field added later is withheld until listed. Every write and every other settings subpath (browser-settings backup, remote executors, cache-billing events, file-access and host-awake status) 403; `GET /api/settings/limited-user-defaults` is theirs to read ([browser defaults](#browser-defaults-for-limited-users)) |
| speech | dictation through the backends the superuser configured: the streaming socket (`GET /api/speech/ws`, and the relayed speech channel), `POST /api/speech/transcribe` and `/prewarm`, and `POST /api/speech/xai-client-secret`, the five-minute xAI secret the direct Grok method streams with. A fresh browser starts on the server-wide speech default in `/api/version` `clientDefaults`, as any client does. `POST /api/speech/xai-client-key` 403 even when the superuser shares the raw key with their own browsers, since a limited user could keep it; backend setup (`/api/speech/backends*`) and the learned vocabulary (`/api/speech/vocabulary*`), drawn from every session's text, 403 |
| recents | the install's shared list, read filtered; clearing 403; `POST /api/recents/visit` answers `{recorded: false}` and records nothing |
| activity REST (`/api/activity/*`) | 403: watcher status and every connected tab and browser profile are host inventory with no project to filter by |
| user administration | 403 except `GET /api/users/me` and `POST /api/users/logout` |
| public shares, app links, devices, bang commands, absolute-path file reads, file editing and artifact rebuild (`/api/file-edit*`), server admin, relay/remote-access config | 403; the session page neither polls share status nor fetches app links for them, so no refusal takes the place of a control |
| images a session read (an Explored image strip and its viewer) | read with the session: served from the session's stored copy through its media route, never by the host-path image read, which also cannot see a sandbox's private `/tmp` |
| refreshing a session's list preview (`refresh-preview`) | anyone who may read the session; it recomputes the excerpt and launches nothing |
| a file a session names (`/api/sessions/:id/local-file`, `/local-image`) and an interactive preview of one (`POST /api/sessions/:id/artifacts`) | reading needs view on the session, a preview `join`. The path is taken as that session sees it — a sandboxed session's `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` are its private ones — and they reach only the session's project and its sandbox's private temp directories, never the host-wide file allow-set; the host-wide `/api/local-file`, `/api/local-image` and `/api/artifacts` stay 403 |
| a server their sandboxed session started (`sandbox-apps`) | `join` on the session, as for a turn: YA mints a private app name reaching that session's sandbox loopback, and the session page offers it in the App pane though operator app links stay withheld ([sandboxed session apps](session-right-pane.md#sandboxed-session-apps)) |
| pre-session draft uploads, validation and deletion | allowed only in the acting account's isolated draft store. A relay upload socket selects the store the same way its tunneled requests resolve the principal, so the owner's relay identity stages into the superuser's store |

The client reaches a session's files through those session-scoped routes
whenever it is on a session page and the server advertises
`session-scoped-local-files`, for the owner too, so a sandboxed session's
`/tmp` path resolves the same way for everyone; an older server gets the
host-wide routes.

Session-to-project resolution for session-scoped paths uses the live process
first and the session catalog second — the same retained catalog All Sessions
and Inbox read. Its access projection refreshes when that retained catalog
publishes a different epoch or generation; otherwise unknown-id and failed-read
bursts remain throttled to one read every five seconds. The publication identity
is read from memory and never initiates provider discovery. A session that resolves to
no project, including one the catalog files under two projects, is refused. List filtering is by project only: a session the user started in a
project whose grant was later removed stays directly readable but no longer
appears in their lists. Sessions the user starts are recorded with `createdByUser` in
session metadata at create time, which is what makes the "always readable"
row above durable. A start that waits for a free worker records it, with the
rest of its launch metadata and sandbox, when the worker starts it.

The same principal check gates websocket subscriptions: a limited user may
subscribe to a session channel only for sessions they may read, and the
global activity channel is filtered to their accessible projects. A
subscription is judged by exactly the ids its channel reads: the session for
the session and Conversation channels, both session and project for the
session-watch channel, the project for the glossary and worktree channels.
Every one of them must be readable; another id beside them, such as a granted
`projectId` on a session subscription, opens nothing. A subscription naming
none of its ids, or on a channel the server does not serve, is refused.

The activity channel is filtered by event type, by default deny. An event
reaches a limited user only when it names a project they may read: directly,
through the session it creates, or through the session it is about, resolved
from what the server already holds in memory (live process, session metadata,
last catalog read); a session that resolves to no project hides its event.
Filtering never waits on the catalog: a session the last read lacked starts a
background read, so that session's later events resolve.
An event listing several projects arrives listing only the readable ones, or
not at all. Signals that carry no project data (backend reload, restart-queue
and catalog refresh counters, minus the catalog's refresh error) arrive so
the client refetches its filtered lists. Host inventory never arrives: watched
provider file paths, YA's own source changes, network binding, browser tabs,
and worker counts. As for lists, the rule is by project only; a session the
user started stays readable through its own channels. A new event type is
hidden until classified.

A `/api/ws` socket acts as the login that opened it, for its whole lifetime.
An SRP socket acts as its proven identity; a directly opened socket acts as
the cookie login of its upgrade request. Its tunneled requests and its
subscriptions are both judged as that login, and a cookie header a client
puts on a tunneled request changes nothing. A limited user's direct socket
therefore gets exactly the 403/404 answers above, never superuser authority.

### Login, switching, and logout

- **Relay.** `srp_hello.identity` selects the verifier: the remote-access
  record for the superuser, else the limited user of that name. An unknown
  or disabled identity gets a challenge computed against a decoy salt and
  verifier and fails only at the proof step. The decoy salt is derived per
  identity from a persisted server secret, so it is stable for a name across
  hellos and restarts, as a real salt is, and differs between names, as real
  salts do: neither a salt shared by every unknown name nor one that changes
  on each hello can pick out the names that exist. Every hello response is
  padded to a fixed floor, and every identity has its own hello limiter, so
  neither response timing nor rate limiting discloses them either. This
  closes the existing early "unknown identity" leak as well. All of this
  applies only while limited users are enabled; with the feature off the
  server answers `srp_hello` exactly as before it existed — an unknown
  identity is refused at once, unpadded, and only the configured superuser
  name has a per-identity limiter. The per-identity limiters are capped;
  at the cap the least recently seen go first, and a limiter currently
  blocking its name goes only when nothing else can, so spraying fresh names
  does not lift a lockout.
- **Direct.** While limited users are enabled, the login page accepts an
  optional username; blank is the superuser. With the feature off it asks for
  the password alone, exactly as before limited users existed, and sends no
  username. It learns which before sign-in from `limitedUsersEnabled` on the
  unauthenticated `GET /api/auth/status`; a server that omits the field reads
  as off. The cookie session records which principal it authenticated.
  The owner's Remote Access username also means the superuser here, matched
  case-insensitively, unless a limited user holds that name: browsers
  autofill the saved relay credential into the username field, and the relay
  already reads that identity as the superuser.
- **A relay-authenticated limited user is locked to that user** for the life
  of the connection: no switch control, and `POST /api/users/switch` is
  refused.
- **Switching (superuser only), from Settings → Users.**
  `POST /api/users/switch {username|null}`
  sets a server-signed `acting user` cookie, accepted only when the request's
  underlying principal is the superuser. Everything after that is evaluated
  as that limited user, which is how the restrictions get tested from one
  browser.
- **Logout.** In Settings → Users. For a switched superuser it clears the
  acting-user cookie and returns them to full access. For a limited user it
  ends the session they logged in with — the relay session, including the
  resume credential their browser saved, or the direct cookie session — and
  returns them to the login they arrived by: the relay login page for a relay
  session, the direct login page otherwise, under the client's application
  base path.

### Settings → Users

User management is an ordinary settings page, not a sidebar panel. A
single-user install must never be shown an account control it has no use
for, so nothing about limited users appears anywhere else until one exists.

- **The page.** Reachable whether or not the feature is on, and ordered so
  the switch comes first: the `limitedUsersEnabled` toggle, then the list of
  users, then an editor. Turning the toggle on is enough to add the first
  user — creating one also turns the feature on server-side, so neither step
  waits on the other. Users appear as one wrapped bar of names, a disabled
  one struck through; pressing a name opens its editor below, and pressing
  it again closes it. The editor header carries the grant summary, any lock,
  an **Enabled** checkbox (disabling keeps the account and asks nothing),
  Act as, and Delete. It takes a new password, the project lists as one
  per-project access level (ungranted projects behind an expander), the
  join-freshness offset and the lock; model and effort completions populate
  from the provider catalog once a provider is chosen, and a blank field is
  unlocked. Nothing waits on a Save button, which is easy to miss beneath
  long sections (maintainer direction, 2026-09-28): a choice saves at once,
  typed text when its field loses focus, and pending text when the editor
  closes, all without leaving the editor. Adding a user asks only name and
  password, then opens that user's editor.
- **Sidebar.** No panel, no shortcut, no switcher, and no logout button for
  a limited login: user management is reached through Settings like any
  other administration. The one exception is the way back for a superuser
  acting as a limited user: while switched, the nav list ends with *Stop
  acting as <username>*, which ends the switch and reloads. Acting as a user
  shows that user's app, so without it the only exit was Settings → Users
  (maintainer direction, 2026-09-28). The acting principal still reports
  `hasLimitedUsers`, a boolean and never a count, for surfaces that need to
  know an install has more than one principal.

- **Delete.** Confirmation names the user and explains that deletion removes
  the account, its grants and usage history while keeping project directories
  and files. Cancel sends no deletion request. Recreating a username creates a
  new account; it does not restore the deleted grants or usage history.

- **New Session, acting as a limited user.** The form offers only what the
  user can actually affect. A locked provider, model, or effort loses its
  picker — provider buttons, the model dropdown and its composer chip menu,
  and the thinking/effort panel — and the sandbox and its network firewall
  lose their toggles; the form launches with both on. What was
  withheld is stated instead, as a non-interactive "Set by your account"
  caption carrying the same abbreviated indicators the rest of YA uses (the
  provider badge for provider and model), plus the locked effort and
  "Sandbox: always on". Nothing in it is focusable or clickable. When the
  lock leaves a field free, that field keeps its ordinary picker; a lock that
  empties the whole provider/model/thinking column gives the column's width
  back rather than leaving a hole. The composer's model chip keeps its badge
  and loses its menu. A locked provider or effort this client cannot name,
  such as one a newer server knows, is still locked: its picker is withheld,
  the caption states the value as stored, and the launch sends it verbatim.

  The lock also outranks saved and per-project defaults in the form, and is
  reapplied over the launch body at submit, so a submit racing the
  acting-principal request still launches inside the lock. A side-session
  recap is cleared, since it cannot run beside the forced sandbox. Hiding
  remains cosmetic: the create route is the enforcement.

  A request names its reasoning budget as a thinking option (`off`, `auto`,
  or `on:<effort>`) while a lock names the bare effort. The route compares the
  effort each names: the same effort in either spelling is agreement, a
  request naming no effort takes the locked one, and a different effort is
  refused naming the locked value.
- **Limited user.** The same page shows them their own username, a read-only
  view of their grants and lock, and Log out. They cannot edit their own
  settings, and the directory is never fetched for them.
- **Their other settings categories are an allowlist.** Every server-settings
  write is 403 for them and whole route families behind these panes are
  denied, so a category they cannot operate is hidden rather than shipped
  inert — Local Access otherwise waits forever on `/api/network-binding`,
  which they may not call. They keep Appearance, Toolbar, Message delivery,
  Speech, Notifications, Users, and About. Speech shows them its
  browser-local dictation choices (backend among those the server
  advertises, their own xAI key, capture and Smart Turn options) but not
  the learned vocabulary or backend setup, which are the superuser's; their
  backend choice is saved in their browser only, since the server-wide
  speech default is a settings write. Like the route policy, the list is
  default-deny: a category added later is hidden from limited users until
  someone lists it. A hidden category does not render from a typed URL
  either. Until the server has named the acting principal, Settings offers
  and mounts no category at all, since the client's placeholder principal is
  the superuser and a superuser-only pane would otherwise send its refused
  requests before being hidden. That suppression is about the principal
  alone: a typed URL for a category the server does not serve still gets an
  answer, the category's unsupported-server message
  ([settings placement](settings-ui-placement.md#categories-what-each-is-for)).
- **An older server** without the `limited-users` capability (before
  v0.9.0) loses the category from the Settings list; a typed URL says the
  server lacks limited users, and the Users pane does not mount. The client
  then sends that server no users request and no `limitedUsersEnabled` write,
  which it would drop silently. No other client behavior depends on the
  capability. See [server capabilities](server-capabilities.md).

Nav entries a limited user cannot use are hidden, and the sidebar session
list shows only sessions in their accessible projects plus sessions they
started. Host-administration notices are not shown to a limited user: the
server-changed reload banner, the Codex update prompt, the YA server
update/compatibility notices, the desktop missing-provider notice, the
network-filesystem storage warning, and the first-run onboarding wizard, whose
completion they are refused (`useCanAdministerHost`). The frontend-changed
reload banner stays, since reloading their own page is theirs to do. Hiding is
cosmetic; the middleware above is the enforcement, and it refuses the restart,
safe-restart, and Codex update routes.

### Browser defaults for limited users

User direction, 2026-09-28. The superuser sets browser-local preferences
(theme, fonts, composer and speech options, and the rest of the portable
list the Settings-menu backup carries) once for every limited user's
browser, which each user may then change on their own device.

- **Storage.** A second server-side slot beside the Settings-menu backup,
  with the same shape and bounds, in `limited-user-browser-defaults.json`
  under the data directory. `GET /api/settings/limited-user-defaults` is
  open to limited users; `PUT` is the superuser's alone.
- **Settings → Users** shows a *Browser defaults for limited users* panel
  with the published list, one editable value per setting and a remove
  control per row. *Load from my saved settings* replaces the list with the
  superuser's Settings-menu backup, keeping only portable preferences;
  *Save to limited user settings* publishes it with a new revision time.
  Loading alone publishes nothing.
- **Applying.** A limited user's client applies each published revision
  once per browser, server and account, the next time it opens YA: listed
  settings overwrite the browser's values, unlisted ones are left alone,
  and keys outside the portable list are ignored. When any value changed,
  the page reloads once so every reader picks them up. Later local changes
  stand until the superuser saves again, when the new revision applies once
  more. A storage failure restores the prior values and leaves the revision
  unapplied for the next load. A superuser acting as a limited user is
  skipped, since that browser's settings are the superuser's own.
- **Older servers** lack the `limited-user-browser-defaults` capability:
  the panel is hidden and limited users' clients request nothing.

### Usage

Every principal's work is attributed, so Settings → Users can say who used
this install and how much.

- **Attribution.** A session records the principal who started it, and every
  user turn carries `sentByUser` in its message metadata. Both are stamped
  server-side from the acting principal and never read from the request body,
  so a client cannot attribute its turn to somebody else. **Absent means the
  superuser** — which is also what every session and turn predating this
  means. A YA-injected prompt is nobody's turn and carries no sender.
- **The ledger.** `user-usage.jsonl` in the data directory, one short
  append-only record per session start, per user turn, and per settled
  provider turn's token charge: timestamp, username (absent for the
  superuser), and then a turn's word count or a charge's model short name,
  project name, and input/output token counts. A record is written when the
  server accepts the action:
  - **A session start** is any request that creates a session: start or
    create, with or without a project and including one the supervisor
    holds for a free worker; fork; clone, which includes a `/btw` aside;
    restart, in either mode; fork-after-summary, once its fork exists; and a
    Project Queue new-session item when it is queued. Resume and reactivate
    continue a session and start none.
  - **A user turn** is counted when accepted, whether sent at once, deferred,
    or queued in Project Queue, so a queued turn later deleted still counts.
    A YA command (`/clear`, `/clearloop`, and the like) is no turn, and
    neither is a YA-injected prompt or a recovered queue entry being
    delivered again.

  Appending is the only write on the turn path. A torn record from an
  interrupted append costs itself and nothing else, and so does a failed
  append: it is logged,
  the action it records still succeeds, and later appends proceed. The file
  keeps the newest 50,000 records: once it holds 1,000 more it is trimmed
  oldest-first, so a report's reach shrinks rather than its recent numbers
  going wrong. The count comes from the file on a process's first write, so
  a server restarted before that many appends still trims. Deleting a user
  deletes their records.
- **Interaction time** is the union of the five-minute windows each action
  opens: one lone turn counts five minutes, two turns two minutes apart count
  as one continuous stretch rather than two, and a gap longer than five
  minutes starts a new stretch. This is the whole definition of "presumed
  away after five minutes"; no other idle signal feeds it.
- **Tokens** are what the providers charged for that principal's work, over
  every request their sessions made. Attribution is the session's recorded
  creator, so a charge lands on the principal who started the session that
  caused it. A token record is **nobody's action**: it moves no session count,
  no turn count, and no interaction time.
  - **Four classes, kept apart.** Prompt tokens the provider processed, prompt
    tokens it served from cache, prompt tokens it wrote to cache, and tokens it
    generated. They cost between a fiftieth and one times each other, so one
    summed "tokens" number is a **volume, not a cost** — that is what the page
    labels it, and every cost figure comes from the classes.
  - **Binned by provider, model and context tier**, which is everything the
    price of those counts depends on. The recorder accumulates per live process
    and appends **once per settled provider turn and tier** — on the turn's
    `result` frame, on the next turn starting, or when the process goes away.
  - **One billing frame per provider**, owned by `readBillableUsage`
    (`packages/server/src/sdk/billableUsage.ts`) and separate from the
    cache-miss monitor's growth filter. Claude's assistant frames and Codex's
    out-of-band `token_usage` report each request; codex-oss's
    `turn_complete` and the `result` of pi, OpenCode and Gemini report the
    turn's total. Claude's `result` and Codex's `turn_complete` restate
    requests already reported, so they are not read. **Subagent requests
    count**: a Claude Task subagent's frames are billed to the session that
    delegated to it. Grok and Gemini ACP report no usage YA can read and
    record nothing.
  - **Deduped per turn by response id.** One streaming Claude response repeats
    its usage on every completed content block, and a subagent's frames
    interleave with the main thread's, so each response id counts once per
    turn. A provider that names no response, such as Codex's `token_usage`,
    has each frame taken as its own request, since two real requests may
    legitimately report equal counts.
  - **Cached reads follow the provider's protocol.** OpenAI and Google report
    cached reads inside `input_tokens`; Anthropic-protocol providers, pi and
    OpenCode report them disjointly. The convention is declared per provider,
    so codex-oss is read the OpenAI way like Codex.
  - **The tier is decided at record time**, from the prompt one request
    actually sent, because no later reader can recover a single request's
    length from a sum. **The threshold is the provider's own, and most
    providers have none**: OpenAI reprices the whole request above 272k prompt
    tokens (prompt classes ×2, output ×1.5), while **Anthropic prices its full
    1M window flat** — it removed its own over-200k premium on 2026-03-13, so
    `sonnet[1m]`, `opus[1m]` and `fable[1m]` cost exactly what their short
    requests cost. **A model may carry its own tier, which overrides its
    provider's**: Haiku 5.5, Anthropic's published exception, reprices every
    class ×5 above 100k prompt tokens, and the recorder reads the threshold of
    the model that served the request, so a Haiku 5.5 subagent in an Opus
    session is tiered as Haiku. A record carries the tier only when it is the long one, so an
    install on a provider without one pays nothing for the distinction, and a
    long-context flag on such a provider changes no price. **A turn total is
    recorded at the standard tier**, since its sum names no single request;
    of the providers reporting totals, only codex-oss reads a price list with
    a tier.
- **Cost is reported two ways, from one calculation.** The headline is
  **standard-tier output tokens of the model itself**: the charge's dollars
  divided by the one constant that model charges per output token. It leads
  because it keeps meaning the same thing when a price changes. Dollars are the
  **supplement** — the same calculation before that division.
  - Prices come from two tables, in order. `PUBLISHED_MODEL_PRICES` in
    `packages/shared/src/model-prices.ts` holds rates read from the providers'
    own pricing pages on a stated date, covering the models YA launches that the
    extract does not name — Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Fable/Mythos 5.1, the GPT-5.6
    family, GPT-6 Astra, and the Daybreak alias, which **is** GPT-5.6 Sol and
    carries its rates. Behind it, `packages/shared/src/vendor/pi-model-prices/`
    is a mechanical extract of the `pi` project's per-model rates; its
    `VENDORED.md` owns the upstream revision, and
    `scripts/generate-vendored-model-prices.mjs` refreshes it from a local `pi`
    checkout when someone chooses to.
  - **Per model, not per provider ratio.** Claude Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1
    price a cache read at 0.025x base input where every other Claude model is at
    0.1x, and OpenAI bills cache writes on GPT-5.6 and later but not on GPT-5.4
    or 5.5. A per-provider ratio table would price those models wrong by a
    factor of four.
  - **A model the table does not name still gets an output-token equivalent**,
    from generic ratios midway between the two listed families — output at 5.5
    fresh prompt tokens, a cache read at a tenth of one, a cache write at
    0.625. **It gets no dollar figure**, which is simply not shown rather than
    guessed. Those ratios track real compute asymmetry only roughly, which is
    why they yield a relative unit and never money.
  - **Dollars add across models; output-token equivalents do not.** So a
    per-model bucket shows both, and a per-project or whole-user bucket shows
    dollars alone — one model's output token is not another's, and summing them
    would not be a quantity. A bucket with any unpriced model shows no dollars
    at all, rather than a partial total that reads as the whole.
  - **A fast-mode Claude turn is under-reported.** Anthropic charges Opus 5
    and Opus 4.8 at $10/$50 rather than $5/$25 with `speed: "fast"`, and the
    ledger records no speed, so such a turn is priced at half. Noted in
    gaps/usage-cost-price-table.md.
- **The split is by model and, separately, by project** — never by the two
  together, which multiplies rows without answering a question anybody asked.
  A charge is named by the model that served it (`claude-opus-5-5`): the
  model each Claude frame names, so a subagent on another model is priced at
  that model, else the session's resolved model (see
  [provider abstraction](provider-abstraction.md)). The report groups and
  prices by that id, with a dated snapshot joining its model's row, and shows
  it without the vendor name (`opus-5-5`). The launch alias (`opus`) is kept
  on the record for reference and names rows only for records that predate
  the served id (2026-09-28). Either name may be absent, and an unnamed
  charge collects in one bucket rather than being dropped. Buckets are ranked
  costliest first, with unpriced ones after the priced ones by raw volume.
- **The report.** `GET /api/users/usage`, superuser only, returns per-user
  totals and the same totals restricted to the last seven days, plus the
  timestamp of the earliest record. Settings → Users renders it as tables
  for one window at a time, chosen by a switch: a totals table with one row
  per principal (superuser included) and a column each for time, sessions,
  turns, words and tokens, then per-principal tables splitting tokens by
  model and by project, with a column each for the output-token equivalent,
  the estimated dollars and the volume. A missing figure shows as "—" rather
  than disappearing. The all-recorded window names the
  **calendar days** the ledger spans, counting both ends, because the reader's
  question is which days are in here; the other window says "7 days" rather
  than "last week", which a reader otherwise takes for the last whole calendar
  week. A user with a record of nothing is listed by the
  report but not shown in the table; the ledger starts empty on an existing
  install, so the page says what it covers rather than implying all time.

### Project creation

A limited user creates projects only where the superuser said they may.

- **The grant.** `projectRoot` on the user record, a directory as the
  superuser typed it (`~/archer` keeps that form and expands server-side).
  **Absent means they may create no project at all**, which is the default:
  creation is a grant, not something a limited user has by existing. A
  relative root is no grant either — it would resolve against the server's
  working directory, which is not a boundary anybody chose.
- **The check** is at the route, not in the pure route policy, which cannot
  see a path carried in the body: `POST /api/projects` reaches the route for
  a limited user and is refused there unless the path is under their root.
  The root itself is the parent directory, not a project, and `..` cannot
  walk out of it. Nor can a symbolic link: containment is decided on the
  path as the filesystem resolves it, a project path that is itself a link is
  refused even when it points back inside, and the check is repeated after
  the directory is made and before it is registered. The superuser may still
  add anything.
- **A directory that does not exist yet** is offered rather than refused.
  The client asks, and only a request that explicitly says `create` makes
  it: YA creates the directory, runs `git init`, and leaves one empty commit
  so the first real change has a root revision to diff against. A host that
  configures no Git identity — the fresh machine this is most for — still
  gets that commit, from a fallback identity used for the scaffolding commit
  alone. Without that
  flag a missing path is still a 404, so nothing creates a directory by
  accident. An existing directory is never touched — YA does not run
  `git init` over somebody's tree. For limited users, creation also makes a
  missing configured root and parent directories below it. Before making
  anything, containment follows the nearest existing ancestors, including
  symlinks; a missing descendant cannot hide an escaping ancestor. Template
  creation likewise creates missing parents. Files, dangling symlinks and
  inaccessible parents remain errors.
- **Ownership.** The project records `ownerUsername`, absent for the
  superuser, and it survives a restart, the project being rediscovered by a
  session-directory scan once it has sessions, and the superuser hiding the
  project or adding it again. A limited user adds a directory, never an
  existing project: adding a path that is already a project with another
  owner or none, or one the superuser hid, is refused, while their own
  project may be added again. Ownership is not itself
  access: creating the project also adds it to the creator's new-session
  grants, so it is theirs to list, open, and start sessions in the moment it
  exists. That is an ordinary grant, shown in Settings → Users, and the
  superuser may revoke it like any other.
- **Display.** A project a limited user owns reads as `owner/name` wherever
  a project is named for a person to pick — the Projects page, the project
  selector, the sidebar — because two people's `notes` are otherwise the
  same row. A project code name still wins where one is set.

### Out of v1

Viewers-versus-editors semantics beyond the three lists, session guests,
template-only project creation, the Settings → Limited Users grants recap
and summary line, HTTP Basic, per-user server sockets, the composer's
before-send notice that a message to a cold session will start a new one
(the redirect itself is delivered; see [Freshness](#freshness)), the
superuser's own opt-in to the cutoff, and mid-session lock enforcement for
model or effort changes made by the superuser.

## Principals and login

- **Superuser** — the existing single account. Unchanged semantics; the
  name is only for contrast.
- **Limited user** — `{ username, passwordHash, createdAt, disabled? }`
  in `auth.json`, created and reset only by the superuser. Usernames share
  the relay's label grammar (lowercase, 3–32 characters).
- **Relay login.** What the public relay supports today, from
  `relay-protocol.ts` and `packages/relay/src`: a name is 3–32 characters
  of lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, starting and ending
  alphanumeric; hyphen is the only separator character and is legal inside
  ordinary server names, so the relay cannot parse a `server-user` compound
  and any install may claim `alice-bob` as its own name. One install may
  own any number of names, each on its own server WebSocket; only
  unauthenticated connections are capped per IP, and the slot is released
  once a registration or client protocol is accepted, so many registered
  sockets from one host are fine. The relay never sees SRP: the handshake
  terminates at the YA server, where `srp_hello.identity` must currently
  equal the single configured remote-access username and one verifier
  exists.

  Decision (2026-09-19): **a separate, optional username carried as the SRP
  identity**, not a compound relay name. The hosted login form gets a
  username field beside the server name; the client connects to the server
  name exactly as today for routing, then sends `srp_hello` with the
  limited user's username as identity, and the YA server selects that
  user's salt and verifier. The relay needs no redeploy and learns nothing
  new; there is no squatting or grammar ambiguity; and the principal is
  bound before any API call, as with the superuser. Cost: relay-side
  per-name limits (`muxOpenAttemptsPerMinutePerIpUsername` and the
  five-session cap) are shared by everyone under one server name, so a
  noisy guest can throttle the host; the server's own per-identity SRP
  limiter already exists to contain that.

  **Password managers (2026-10-03).** One relay login form always offers the
  required computer/server name as `name="username"`, with its stable
  `id="relayUsername"` and `autocomplete="username"`. Password uses
  `name="password"` and `autocomplete="current-password"`. Opening Advanced
  never changes these attributes. The optional **Log in as** field lives under
  Advanced, marked experimental, with `name="limited-user"` and
  `autocomplete="off"`; it is absent from the DOM while Advanced is collapsed.
  An `?as=` link expands Advanced to show its prefilled limited-user name.
  Blank means owner; an explicitly supplied name selects that limited user's
  identity without changing or inferring the required computer name. Collapsing
  Advanced preserves an explicitly entered override. Owner submission never
  copies the computer name into the limited-user field. Submission reads live
  form values so autofill works even before React receives an input event.
  These hints prioritize existing owner credentials; browsers and password
  managers may still apply their own heuristics, and automatic saving/restoring
  of all three limited-user login values is not promised.

  **Identity lookup and timing.** The server resolves the `srp_hello`
  identity by a constant-time map lookup of username to salt and verifier
  before the one modular exponentiation SRP needs per attempt, so cost does
  not grow with the number of users. Response time must not reveal whether
  a username exists (decided 2026-09-19): an unknown identity runs the
  same challenge computation against a decoy salt and verifier and
  returns an indistinguishable error only at the proof step, and the
  handler pads every hello response to a minimum elapsed time (sleep to a
  floor such as the observed p95 of a real challenge) so a fast path cannot
  be distinguished from a slow one. The remaining signal is what network
  timing resolution allows: an attacker sees only round-trip times through
  the relay, so the floor needs to hide millisecond-scale differences, not
  microsecond ones, and jitter from the relay hop already masks most of
  it. Today the single configured name already leaks existence by
  answering "unknown identity" early; this closes that too.

  **Per-user server sockets** remain an option a new YA server can add
  without relay changes: register `<server>-<username>` on an additional
  socket per enabled user (an install may own many names), which gives
  relay-side per-user visibility and separate limits at the price of one
  relay socket per user and exposing usernames to the relay operator. It
  is a later refinement for hosts that need relay-side isolation, not the
  v1 login path, and it must still bind the principal from the SRP
  identity rather than trusting the name alone, since names are
  first-come claims.
- **Direct login.** The login page gains a username field, blank meaning
  superuser. For non-browser clients and for the simplest possible remote
  path, standard HTTP Basic over HTTPS is accepted as an alternative to the
  cookie flow, for limited users only: `Authorization: Basic` with
  `username:password`, verified against the same hash, rate-limited like
  login. The superuser is deliberately not reachable over Basic, so the
  operator credential never travels as a header. Basic is refused on plain
  HTTP except loopback.
- **Localhost-open and auth-disabled** are superuser-only modes; enabling a
  limited user requires enforced authentication. (Session sandboxing once
  shared this interlock; since 2026-09-27 it only warns.)

## Authorization

A server-side check on every request, not a client filter. The principal is
attached by the auth middleware; each route family declares what a limited
user may do:

| surface | limited user |
|---|---|
| Projects list, project pages | only owned or member projects; others 404, not 403 |
| New Project | only from a template ([[project-templates]]), into a parent directory the superuser configured for that user; the created project is owned by them |
| Add existing directory | refused |
| Sessions in a member project | create, message, approve, fork, rewind; sandbox forced on; provider/model/effort within the user's lock (below) |
| Sessions elsewhere | 404 |
| Files, source control, git status | within member projects only; the same sandbox roots the session sees |
| Server-wide settings | read where harmless, write refused |
| Apps settings | only rows reserved for their projects ([[project-templates]] § Persistent app-name reservations); Public is available only when the superuser has disabled Private apps only, and remains explicit opt-in |
| Public shares, app links | within member projects only |
| Devices, push, browser profile | their own |
| Agents/process view, Inbox, All Sessions | filtered to member projects |

The superuser sees everything and additionally the members UI.

Ownership is stored server-side, keyed by project id, in a new
`project-access.json`: `{ projectId: { owner: username | "superuser",
editors: [username], viewers: [username] } }`. It is YA app data, never a
file in the project ([[project-directory-storage]]).

**Members UI.** On the project page, superuser or owner only: an editors
list (add by username, remove), and later a viewers list. Editor means
start sandboxed sessions and everything in the table above. Viewer, later:
see sessions and transcripts, open the project's app, but no turns, no new
sessions, no files outside what the transcript shows.

**Session guest.** A second, narrower grant shape for live sharing of one
session with another person ("multiplayer"): the superuser, or a project
owner, creates a username and password whose entire scope is **one named
session**. Through the relay (the "reflector") the guest logs in with the
server name plus their own username as SRP identity, like any limited user,
so the server always knows which guest a connection is; on direct access it
uses the same login or HTTP Basic path. This credential flow remains a candidate;
the newer collaboration direction below also considers redeemed invitations.
A guest sees that session's transcript and only the participation actions
explicitly granted to them, and sees nothing else: no project
page, no file APIs beyond what the transcript shows, no session creation, no
fork. Anticipating the grant, the host may launch the session sandboxed at
creation so the guest's turns are confined; the earlier proposal allowed an
unsandboxed guest session with a plain warning in the members UI. This remains
an admission/execution-boundary decision before implementation, not a claim that
an exact-session API grant confines the provider's OS authority. The earlier
storage sketch placed guest records in `project-access.json` beside memberships:
`{ session: sessionId, guests: [{ username, mode: "turns" | "read" }] }`.
Its coarse modes are superseded by the separate action grants below. Exact
storage and credential formats remain unselected.
Revoking a guest ends their access and ongoing subscriptions. The
stale-session cutoff applies to guests too, but as **expiry rather than
redirect**: a guest grant is temporary and ends when the shared session has
been inactive for the configured cutoff, since a redirect into a new session
would fall outside the grant and an exemption would let a cold session be
resumed at full cost. The guest sees the remaining time and, once expired, a
plain "this share has ended" page; the host may re-share. A
session-continuation authority (which successor session a guest may follow
into) is not proposed here.

**Session collaboration refinement (2026-09-30; not implemented).** The
[Participatory Live Share sketch](relay-origin-and-share-gating.sketches.md#participatory-live-share)
now owns the narrower trusted-colleague direction: human discussion first,
owner-reviewed prompt suggestions next, and optionally explicit send and
session-queue grants. Steer is separately granted; Project Queue is a later
possibility, not part of an exact-session input grant. A suggestion remains
outside the execution queue until the owner applies an exact revision.
The earlier idea that guest turn access includes tool approvals is superseded.
Approvals, bypass/permission modes, model/effort settings, stop/restart, and
share management remain owner-only. This refinement does not narrow or change
the delivered project-level limited-user join contract above.

[Session notes and discussion](session-notes-and-discussion.md) owns human-only
scratch notes and chat, which confer no provider authority. Invitation-bound
participants and eventual local/hosted accounts share the conceptual boundary
in [principals and grants](principals-and-grants.md#session-collaboration-and-future-accounts);
neither a full limited-user account nor project membership is a prerequisite
selected for temporary session collaboration. The inactivity-based expiry above
remains a candidate; actual invitation/grant lifetimes and interaction with
freshness need a contract before implementation.

**Provider lock.** The superuser may pin a limited user to a provider, a
provider plus model, or provider plus model plus effort; any subset is
representable, but those three are the expected shapes. Stored on the user
record as `lock: { provider?, model?, effort? }`. Semantics:

- **New sessions** the user creates take the locked values, and the New
  Session form shows those fields fixed rather than offering a choice. A
  locked value beats [[session-defaults]] and any per-project default.
- **Existing sessions.** By default a limited user may send turns only to
  sessions whose current provider, model, and effort all fall within the
  lock; a session outside it is visible in member projects but read-only for
  that user, with the reason shown. The superuser may relax this per user
  (`lock.existingSessions: "any"`), which keeps the lock for creation only.
- **Mid-session changes** ([[mid-session-effort-change]], model switches)
  are refused for a locked field.
- The lock bounds what the user can spend and which provider account they
  reach; it is enforced server-side at session create and message routes,
  never only hidden in the form.

The check reuses the same provider, model, and effort identifiers the
session-create route already validates, so a lock names only values the
server could launch. An unlaunchable locked value blocks the user's session
creation with a clear message rather than silently falling back.

**Stale-session cutoff.** A child or casual user does not know that
resuming a session idle for a day misses its prompt cache and costs far more
than a fresh one. A per-user setting, a time slider (`staleAfter`), makes YA
redirect: when the user sends a turn to a session whose last activity is
older than the cutoff, the message instead opens a **new session** in the
same project. The slider is an **offset against the believed cache-warm
window of the session's provider and model**, not an absolute duration: the
per-provider retention window that [[prompt-cache-keepalive]] already
tracks is the zero point (currently configured as one hour for Claude and
ten minutes for Codex, which is fine for now). The slider ranges from −5
minutes (redirect slightly before the cache is believed cold) to +60 minutes
of grace, with a separate off position; the default offset is 0. One user
setting therefore behaves sensibly across providers without the user
knowing either window. The new session's first turn is
the user's text, prefixed with a short reference to the previous session
(its YA id and title) and a hint that the agent should read it if the
request refers to something not otherwise explained; the previous session is
left untouched. Beyond the cutoff the old session's composer shows the
redirect plainly ("this will start a new session"), so the behavior is
visible rather than surprising, and the superuser may set the slider to off
to keep ordinary resume behavior. The redirect is server-side at the message
route, keyed by the session's last activity time, so a stale client cannot
bypass it. The superuser may opt into the same setting for their own account
(decided 2026-09-19); it is off for the superuser by default and required
only for limited users. For session guests the cutoff expires the grant
instead of redirecting, as stated above.

## Grants management

Guest grants that are temporary by default make an explicit **permanent**
grant a deliberate act, and that act needs a place where everything the
host has handed out can be seen at once. Today the sub-operator grants are
scattered: public session shares have their own authenticated management
routes, app links are revoked per row in Settings → Apps, and interactive
artifact links have no inventory at all
([`gaps/artifact-grant-revocation-ui.md`](../gaps/artifact-grant-revocation-ui.md),
[`gaps/app-artifact-access-control.md`](../gaps/app-artifact-access-control.md)).

Proposed: a **Settings → Limited Users** category, superuser only, that is
both the user directory and the grants recap:

- **Users.** Each limited user with lock, stale cutoff, parent directory,
  enabled/disabled, last login, and reset/disable/delete actions.
- **Project memberships.** Every project's owner, editors, and viewers, the
  same data the per-project members UI edits, listed across projects so a
  name can be found and removed everywhere in one place.
- **Live shares.** Every session guest grant: session, guest name, mode,
  temporary or permanent, remaining time, last seen, revoke. A permanent
  guest is created only here or from the session's share menu with an
  explicit "does not expire" choice, and is marked in this list.
- **Document and app grants.** A read-only recap of the other bearer
  grants the host has outstanding, with revoke: public session shares, app
  links per vhost row and their generation, and interactive artifact links.
  This is the inventory the two gaps above ask for; landing it here rather
  than as three panes is the point of the recap.

Each row links to the surface that owns it (the project page, the Apps row,
the session), and the recap never becomes a second editor for those
records; it lists and revokes.

**Summary line.** The category opens with one line so a host can tell at a
glance what is shared, in this shape:

```text
3 URL-enabled public grants (1 permanent, 2 temporary, expiring 2m–7d) ·
2 username-gated grants active (1 permanent, 1 temporary, expiring 4h) ·
exposing 2 projects and 4 project templates to limited users
```

- *URL-enabled public grants* count everything reachable by link alone:
  public session shares, app links, artifact links, and Public vhost rows.
- *Username-gated grants* count session guests and project memberships
  held by limited users.
- *Exposing N projects* counts projects with at least one limited-user
  member or guest; *N project templates* counts templates limited users may
  create from ([[project-templates]]).
- Wherever a kind can be either, permanent and temporary are counted
  separately, and the temporary count shows its expiry range from soonest to
  latest (for example `2m–7d`), or a single value when they coincide.
  Kinds that cannot expire show no range.

The category is hidden entirely when no limited user, guest, or bearer
grant exists, in keeping with [[settings-ui-placement]] and
[[vanilla-defaults]].

## Execution boundary

The [[session-sandboxing]] Linux mechanism is the enforcement floor: a
limited user's session is confined to its project tree with the sandbox's
fixed private roots, and cannot be launched unsandboxed or on a non-Linux
host or remote executor until those gain an equivalent boundary. That topic
currently declines to call itself a hostile multi-tenant sandbox; this
proposal does not change that claim by fiat. Before limited users ship, the
sandbox's threat model must be re-read for the case "the person typing the
prompt is not the machine owner", in particular: provider credentials in the
child environment, the project parent directory the user may create into,
shared caches between users' sessions, and `!!` bang commands, which run in
the project directory outside the provider and must run inside the same
sandbox or be refused for limited users.

Sessions of different users on one host share YA's process, event bus, and
data dir. The isolation claim is authorization plus per-session filesystem
confinement, not process-level tenancy; [[security]] § Limited Users states
that boundary and its exclusions.

## App access for members and the public

Today an app is reached either by a bearer URL or by the row's explicit
`public` flag; URL possession is the authorization unit
([[active-content-security]]). Members get bearer links for their projects'
apps through the existing links route, filtered by membership. Viewers,
later, get the same links read-only.

Wanting an app open to the public while still knowing who is visiting is a
distinct request: it is about fetching the bundle at all, not the app's own
accounts. It is tracked as
[`gaps/sketches/app-public-access-with-identity.md`](../gaps/sketches/app-public-access-with-identity.md)
rather than decided here.

## Phases

When choosing an implementation shape for these phases, note how it uses or
defers the relevant shared seams from [[principals-and-grants]]: stable
principal identity, authenticated request context, grant and local-policy
enforcement, credential provenance, and revocation. An incremental phase need
not implement every credential source or grant type.

1. **Principals.** Limited-user records, superuser-managed creation and
   reset, username on the direct login page, HTTP Basic for limited users,
   principal attached by middleware. No authorization changes yet, so a
   limited user is refused everywhere until phase 2; the phase is only
   useful as a landing for tests. ‖
2. **Project access.** `project-access.json`, owner and editors, route-family
   checks from the table, members UI, 404 scoping of lists and pages,
   forced sandbox, bang-command refusal or confinement, provider lock and
   stale-session cutoff at create and message routes. ‖
3. **Relay.** Per-user SRP verifiers selected by `srp_hello` identity,
   hosted-client login with a username field, pairing flow update
   ([[mobile-server-pairing]]); no relay redeploy. ‖
4. **Viewers**, **session guests**, and the template-only New Project for
   limited users, plus the Settings → Limited Users grants recap, once
   [[project-templates]] phase 2 exists. Guests may land
   earlier than viewers since their scope is one session and needs no
   project-level filtering beyond a 404 for everything else.

## Open decisions

- Whether relay-side per-user limits justify per-user server sockets, or a
  later relay protocol field carrying the user beside the server name once
  a redeploy is planned for other reasons.
- Per-user settings partition: which browser-local preferences should become
  server-side per-user (theme, session defaults) and whether that is worth a
  fourth settings scope in [[settings-ui-placement]].
- Whether owners may add editors themselves or only the superuser may.
- Whether limited users may use provider accounts of the host at all, or
  must bring their own ([[copilot-provider]] already notes per-user tokens
  for a hosted case).
- Rate limits and session caps per limited user, extending the relay's
  five-session cap.
- Session-continuation authority for guests: when a shared session is
  forked, rewound into a new session, or redirected by the host's own stale
  cutoff, which successor if any the guest may follow into.
