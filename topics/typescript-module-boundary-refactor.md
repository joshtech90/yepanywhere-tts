# Module Boundary Refactor Discipline

Tactical worklog: the slice ledger, baseline gate, and large-file inventory
live in
[`docs/tactical/058-typescript-module-boundary-refactor.md`](../docs/tactical/058-typescript-module-boundary-refactor.md).
This topic is the binding contract; the tactical doc records progress against
it. When the two disagree, this topic wins and the tactical doc gets fixed.

## Contract

- The campaign goal is code health: smaller ownership boundaries along seams
  that already exist. It is not a line-count quota, a folder-taxonomy
  redesign, or an abstraction hunt.
- Line-count reduction is supporting evidence, not the reason to move code. A
  move is worthwhile only when it isolates a coherent domain, improves a
  route/test boundary, or separates provider-specific from generic behavior.
- The unit of work is a slice: one cohesive extraction, one commit, ledger row
  updated in the same commit. A slice small enough to review in one pass beats
  a slice that empties a file.
- Behavior is frozen. A behavior problem discovered mid-slice becomes a
  recorded follow-up, never an inline fix.

## What A Slice May Do

- Move symbols verbatim to a new or existing domain-named module.
- Update imports of the moved symbols in production and test files.
- Convert closure-captured dependencies of a moved helper into explicit
  parameters when the move requires it. This is the one permitted signature
  change; it applies to module-private helpers only and must be called out in
  the landing note.
- Move exported-for-test symbols and repoint their focused tests at the new
  module, so utility exports stop widening the big file's surface.

## What A Slice Must Not Do

- Change runtime behavior, response shapes, error strings, log messages,
  ordering, or timing.
- Rename public facades: route factory names, mounted paths, exported
  component props, provider interfaces, API client names, or test helper
  entry points.
- Apply organize-imports or formatting cleanup beyond the moved symbols.
- Delete dead code, fix latent bugs, or tighten types in passing — record
  them as proposed follow-ups instead.
- Add runtime dependencies, new abstractions, or provider-generalizing
  layers.
- Fix baseline test/log chatter inside a move slice. Chatter fixes are their
  own slices so regressions stay attributable.

## Naming And Placement

- No generic buckets. `helpers.ts`, `utils.ts`, `misc.ts`, and an
  `index.ts` grab-bag are all forbidden destinations. A new module gets a
  narrow domain name (`session-compact-thresholds.ts`,
  `session-claude-resume-guard.ts`) or the code stays put.
- Follow the sibling convention of the package being touched. Server routes
  use flat domain-named files in `routes/`; client code uses feature
  directories and hooks under existing homes such as `lib/sessionDetail/`.
  A slice never introduces a new folder taxonomy.
- The new module must not import the file it was extracted from. If the move
  needs a back-reference, the seam is wrong — stop and re-cut.
- Importers update to the new module path. No re-export shims from the old
  location, with one exception: documented public facades (for example the
  client `api` facade) keep their surface until callers migrate deliberately.

## Coordination

- A file already governed by an active ledger or tactical series is refactored
  through that ledger, not around it. Known owners:
  - `packages/server/src/routes/sessions.ts` →
    `docs/tactical/053-sessions-route-refactor-ledger.md` (SRR items);
  - session-detail data layer →
    `docs/tactical/043-session-detail-data-layer-plan.md`;
  - transport → `docs/tactical/057-source-transport-boundary.md`;
  - Project Queue / workstreams files, including route mounting in `app.ts`
    → `docs/tactical/054-workstreams.md` (WS items).
- Before claiming a slice, scan the ledger in doc 058, the owning docs above,
  and recent `git log` for an in-flight series touching the same files. If an
  overlap exists, defer the slice or coordinate in the owning doc first.
- Follow the AGENTS.md commit lock protocol and commit message guidance. Every
  slice commit carries `Topic: typescript-module-boundary-refactor`, plus the
  owning series' topic trailer when the slice lands through another ledger.

## Tripwire Matrix

Read the listed material before editing; run the listed extra verification on
top of the tiers below. Relocation is never permission to redesign the
behavior these documents protect.

| Touched area | Read first | Extra verification |
|---|---|---|
| Queues, timers, liveness, reconnect, catch-up, heartbeat, replay, fan-out | `topics/architecture-mandates.md` and its linked docs | `pnpm test:e2e:sdk` |
| Client transcript/rendering, scroll, row identity | `packages/client/RENDERING_PERFORMANCE.md`, `topics/scrollback-view-stability.md` | `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`; manual browser pass for scroll slices |
| Transport, relay, SRP, NaCl, readiness | `topics/source-transport.md` | full transport test files |
| Codex provider source/protocol | Codex version bump audit rules in `AGENTS.md` | Codex provider tests; stream/persisted render parity where relevant |
| `app.ts` mounting, middleware, auth | `topics/hard-development-rules.md` | route tests asserting preserved public paths |
| Moved user-visible copy | — | `pnpm i18n:scan` |
| Client console call sites | `topics/console-chatter.md` | `pnpm console:scan` must not exceed the committed budget |

## Verification Tiers

Every slice records which tier ran and why it suffices.

- **Tier 1 — every slice.** `pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/shared build` plus
  the touched package's `tsc --noEmit`, the focused tests for the touched
  area, `node scripts/biome.cjs lint` on the changed files, and
  `git diff --check`. Before committing, review the staged move with
  `git diff --cached --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`: moved blocks should render
  as moves, and any non-move hunk must be explainable as an import edit or a
  declared dependency-parameter conversion.
- **Tier 2 — any slice at medium+ risk, and before ending a work session
  that landed slices.** Root `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`.
- **Tier 3 — route registration moves, client-visible surface moves, and
  phase completion.** Run the relevant full E2E suite plus the
  tripwire-matrix extras. For client/browser coverage, the default gate is
  `pnpm --filter client test:e2e --grep-invert "physical Android"`: this is
  the full client Playwright suite except the environment-gated physical
  Android device smoke. Run `pnpm test:e2e:android` only for slices that touch
  physical-device streaming, device bridge behavior, or Android-specific
  transport assumptions. For server/provider coverage, use
  `pnpm test:e2e:sdk` as relevant.

Skipping a required tier is allowed only with a recorded reason and a named
substitute check in the landing note.

## Stop Conditions

Halt the slice — shrink it, or revert and record — when any of these
surfaces:

- The code does not compile after a verbatim move without editing logic
  (anything beyond import paths and the permitted dependency-parameter
  conversion).
- The extraction exposes shared mutable state, module-init side effects, or an
  ordering dependency between the old and new module.
- The move would create an import cycle or a back-import into the source
  file.
- Tests need assertion changes, not just import-path changes.
- The file turns out to be owned by an in-flight series (see Coordination).

A stopped slice is not a failure; it is the discipline working. Record what
was found as a proposed follow-up with enough detail that a later session can
decide.

## Review Checklist

- Diff reads as moves under `--color-moved`; non-move hunks are imports or
  declared parameter conversions only.
- New module name states a domain, not a category of code.
- No re-export shim left behind; no import back into the source file.
- Public facades, mounted paths, response shapes, and error strings
  unchanged.
- Ledger row updated in the same commit; landing note lists moved symbols and
  the verification tier that ran.
- Console budget, i18n scan, and owning-ledger process respected where the
  tripwire matrix requires them.

## Non-Goals

- Enforcing a hard repository-wide LOC limit.
- Introducing a new folder taxonomy across the repo.
- Converting large components to compound component patterns.
- Replacing existing store/transport/session-detail plans.
- Adding virtualization, new queues, new transport buffering, or new provider
  abstractions as part of file-size cleanup.
- A shared pub/sub abstraction: `ARCHITECTURE.md` says wait for a third
  pub/sub.
