## Summary classes

`SessionSummary` is the complete server summary contract for one transcript
version. Required fields such as `messageCount` describe the whole transcript;
tail-derived fields such as context usage, current model, and recent agent text
are present when the provider can derive them.

`SessionListSummary` is a bounded projection for collection routes that need
only identity, title, provider, recency, and optional user-owned list
decorations:

- `id`;
- `projectId`;
- `title`;
- `fullTitle`;
- `updatedAt`;
- `provider`;
- `asyncQuestions` when independently observed within its bounded recent
  window, including an explicit indication of omitted history;
- `customTitle`, `isArchived`, and `isStarred` when an upstream enrichment
  already supplied them.

Unknown full-summary values are absent from the list type. A list reader must
not manufacture placeholder counts or expose an early model as though it were
the current model. Providers may obtain the projection from native metadata, a
bounded transcript-head read, or a complete summary that is already known
fresh.

List `updatedAt` is provider activity recency, not necessarily a literal file
modification timestamp. Plain Codex rollouts on Windows use the later of file
modification and change time because the last-write timestamp may remain stale
while Codex holds its append handle open. YA-owned collection rows may advance
further to the live process's later message time. These recency overlays do not
claim that message count, model, context usage, or tail text were re-observed.

## Reader and index contract

A provider that implements a lightweight list-summary reader must bound its
work independently of transcript tail size. Reading enough head data to find
stable metadata and the first user title is allowed; scanning to EOF merely to
populate fields outside `SessionListSummary` is not.

Codex question previews read bounded head metadata and at most the final 2 MiB,
not a full parse. They stop at 128 questions or 32 subsequent user turns and
retain only 320-character preview titles. A process-wide, source-versioned
single-flight cache retains at most 8 MiB of preview results and rejects a
result when the rollout's stat version changes during the read. Compressed
rollouts leave this optional projection unknown. A fresh indexed Codex row
without the projection supplies its base facts to the lightweight reader, which
acquires the question preview without rereading the transcript head. Dirty or
stat-mismatched rows cannot supply this hint. Neither this acquisition nor its
cache advances complete-summary freshness or rewrites the complete index. The
observable discovery and omission semantics live in
[`provider-output-contract.md`](provider-output-contract.md#discovery-from-inbox-and-session-navigation).

Reference-backed forks and reverted rollouts mark inherited history as omitted
when the leaf has not established that it is older than 32 user turns. A short
leaf with no local questions therefore cannot claim a complete empty inventory.
The preview does not traverse ancestors; the logical detail reader still
recovers inherited questions. This preserves bounded collection reads at the
cost of leaving inherited questions out of the bounded preview.

The persisted session-summary index remains a complete-summary cache:

- a fresh complete row may be projected down to `SessionListSummary`;
- a dirty or stat-mismatched row may fall back to the lightweight reader;
- a lightweight result must not replace the complete row;
- a lightweight result must not update the row's indexed byte count, file
  mtime, or any equivalent "fully summarized through here" marker;
- serving a lightweight collection must not clear watcher dirty state needed
  by a later complete-summary consumer.

In retained collection mode, acquiring a Codex base row explicitly defers the
question projection. The catalog publishes base rows first, then reads optional
previews for non-archived sessions. Exact retained rows need no repeated head
read. Claude titles use a bounded 256 KiB prefix; native providers may remain at
identity fidelity when they have no cheap title. Unknown title/full-prompt,
message count, and tail detail fields are omitted from retained responses.
Known client details survive these partial observations.

On the existing complete-request path, providers without a lightweight reader
retain their existing complete-summary
fallback. This preserves provider behavior while allowing providers with large
append-only transcripts to opt into bounded list work.

## Partial observation contract

REST collection projections and activity events are field patches when reduced
into the client summary store:

- an omitted field preserves an existing value;
- `undefined` means "not observed", not "clear this field";
- an explicit nullable value may clear only a field whose event or snapshot
  contract defines that meaning;
- a newer low-fidelity observation must not replace a known complete value with
  a placeholder or approximation;
- observing a newer `updatedAt` does not imply that message count, model,
  context usage, or recent-agent text were observed at the same fidelity.

Producers must therefore construct patches by selecting known fields. They must
not spread a list projection over a complete summary and must not copy values
from a compatibility-shaped head result into complete-summary event fields.

`ExternalSessionTracker` follows the same rule. Codex file changes use the
bounded list reader and may emit title, `updatedAt`, and observed question
previews; they do not emit
message count, model, context usage, or recent-agent text. The owned Codex SDK
and later complete-summary reads remain authoritative for those fields.
Providers whose tracker read is complete may continue emitting their exact
fields.

## Inbox behavior

Inbox needs title and transcript recency for filtering, tiering, sorting, and
unread checks. It does not require message count, model, context usage, or
recent-agent text.

For providers with a lightweight list reader, an Inbox refresh:

- reuses a complete indexed row only when that row is still fresh;
- otherwise reads the bounded list projection;
- does not wait for a full parse of a changed large transcript;
- does not alter what later complete-summary consumers receive.

Global Sessions, project session lists, Inbox, process labels, and other
collection surfaces should read the retained compact catalog described in
[`session-catalog-observation.md`](session-catalog-observation.md). They may
project a fresh complete index row but must not require one. Explicit session
detail and features whose contract names complete-summary fields keep using the
complete index path.

## Cleanup ledger

| Area | Current compatibility | Desired direction | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Head reads | Production bounded consumers use `SessionListSummary`; Codex retains `readMode: "head"` only inside its typed adapter and direct parser tests. | Retire the compatibility-shaped reader option when no external/internal test contract needs it. | Changing the Codex summary reader API. |
| Activity events | Codex external tracking emits only list-known title/recency and bounded question previews; complete index and non-Codex tracker events retain exact fields. | Use dedicated discovery/list events if another producer cannot provide the complete `session-created` shape. | Adding a partial session-creation producer. |
| Client freshness | Content fields currently share a coarse observation timestamp. | Split freshness by field or fidelity if independent producers begin updating overlapping content fields at materially different precision. | Evidence of a newer partial field blocking a valid richer update. |
