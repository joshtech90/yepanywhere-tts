Topic: session-rewind

Status: implemented 2026-09-18 for Claude (`/clear N`, `/fork N`, the
turn-menu Clear entries, rewound groups in the main session view, and
`/clearloop` with the inactivity boundary). Hardened 2026-09-19: the pending
rewind is consumed at the supervisor's process-launch seam rather than by the
`/resume` route, a drop-guard refusal deletes its record, forks and clones of
a session with an armed rewind keep the cut, cached client transcripts
reload across a rewind, an idle reap no longer ends a clearloop, and the tail
window counts live turns. Corrected 2026-09-19 after a 69-iteration loop: a
watching tab no longer folds every earlier group inside the newest one (only a
dropped cut nests), and delivered queued messages and durable receipts inside a
cleared span are grouped with it instead of rendering as live rows scattered
through the collapsed history. Known limits: the sidebar does not nest rewound
groups, `/clear 0` starts a new session rather than rewinding in place, and
secondary readers (catalog previews, search, counts) still project without
records until the next turn
([gaps/rewind-records-ignored-by-secondary-readers.md](../gaps/rewind-records-ignored-by-secondary-readers.md)).
Codex: `thread/revert` is in YA's generated protocol as of 2026-09-19, so the
Codex rewind is unblocked follow-on work (see § Defaults and compatibility and
[gaps/fork-is-the-only-rewind-and-changes-the-cache-key.md](../gaps/fork-is-the-only-rewind-and-changes-the-cache-key.md)
for the provider primitives and the cache measurements that motivated this).

## Vocabulary

- **The session is the full sequence.** YA's logical session is every turn
  ever made, in transcript order, including turns a clear later removed from
  the assistant's context. A clear changes which turn the next turn's parent
  is (the kept prefix stays byte-identical, so the prompt cache stays warm);
  it never removes turns from the session's history.
- **Turn index `N`.** The 1-based ordinal of a real user turn over that full
  sequence, cleared turns included. Tool-result user rows, compact rows,
  injected context, and synthetic rows are not turns (same boundary rule as
  [fork-from-turn](fork-from-turn.md)). `N` therefore never renumbers: after
  `/clear 2` the cleared turns keep 3–5 and the next new turn is 6, and its
  turn menu shows `[6]`. Server normalization stamps the ordinal on each
  user turn (`turnIndex`), and both the tooltip and `/clear N` resolve
  through that one stamp, which is the invariant. `N = 0` names the empty
  prefix before turn 1.
- **Cut.** The last kept chain entry. *After turn N* keeps turn N's prompt
  and its complete response; *before turn N* keeps everything preceding
  turn N's prompt, which is the same cut as *after turn N−1*.
- **Rewind.** Drop everything past the cut from the provider's live
  conversation while keeping the session id. On Claude this is the SDK's
  truncating resume (`resume` + `resumeSessionAt`), so it is a process
  restart; the transcript file keeps the dropped rows as a dead branch.
- **Rewound group.** The dropped tail, kept in YA's durable session view as
  one collapsed outline entry at the cut.

## Commands

All three are YA-routed commands resolved by the composer's typed command
resolver before provider ingress (`parseComposerSlashCommand`,
`handleCustomCommand`). Their argument text is parsed by their handler, not
the generic layer. They are available only when the server advertises the
`session-rewind` capability and the session's provider supports rewind;
otherwise the command menu marks them unavailable and a typed invocation
fails visibly with the draft retained (never falls through as prompt text).

- **`/clear N`** — rewind to the cut *after turn N*. Turn N and its response
  are the new tail. `/clear` with no argument is `/clear 0`.
- **`/clear 0`** — drop every turn. On Claude the first chain entry is turn
  1's own prompt row, so the truncating resume cannot express an empty
  prefix. v1 therefore implements `/clear 0` on Claude as the existing Clear
  action from [session-context-actions](session-context-actions.md): it
  opens the new-session form for the same project, provider, and model and
  leaves the old session untouched. The grouped-in-place guarantee below
  applies to `N ≥ 1`.
- **`/fork N`** — identical to the turn menu's **Fork after this turn** at
  turn N: a new cold session keeping through turn N. This session is
  unchanged.
- **`/clearloop [N] M: <prompt>`** — repeat: rewind to *after turn N*, send
  `<prompt>`, wait for the iteration to end, M times. The colon after `M` is
  required and separates the counts from the prompt, which is taken
  verbatim (leading whitespace trimmed). When `N` is omitted, `N` is the last
  turn still in the conversation — the index that turn's own **Clear after
  this turn** offers, not a higher ordinal held by an already-dropped turn —
  so the first rewind is a no-op and `/clear N` followed by
  `/clearloop M: p` is equivalent to `/clearloop N M: p`. That no-op first
  rewind may or may not leave a group header; it has nothing to expand
  either way. A session with no live turn has no "here" to loop from and
  reports that instead. `M ≥ 1`.

**Native `/clear` is deliberately shadowed.** The
[emulated-slash-commands](emulated-slash-commands.md) rule that a
provider-native command wins has one exception here: Claude's native
`/clear` starts a fresh context with no YA history, and the whole point of
`/clear N` is the kept id and the durable group. The composer's command
menu shows the YA entry, not the provider's, for `clear` on rewind-capable
providers.

## Turn menu

The existing per-prompt **Fork from this turn** menu
(`ForkTurnMenu`, rendered by `UserPromptBlock`) gains two same-session
entries on rewind-capable providers, after the fork entries:

- **Clear after this turn** — `/clear N` for this turn.
- **Clear replacing this turn** — `/clear N−1` for this turn, then put this
  turn's prompt text into the composer as the draft (the Codex Esc-Esc
  shape), replacing whatever draft was there. Turn 1 has no earlier
  boundary, so the entry reports that `/clear 0` is the new-session Clear.

The menu's trigger tooltip becomes **Fork from this turn [N]** so the index a
user types into `/clear N`, `/fork N`, and `/clearloop N …` is discoverable
from the turn it names. Both entries are disabled while the selected or
latest response is still active, exactly like Fork after; the menu never
waits implicitly. An accepted command clears the persisted composer draft as
a sent message would, so a reload does not restore it.

## Server rewind operation

`POST /api/projects/:projectId/sessions/:sessionId/rewind` with
`{ cut: { kind: "after-user-turn" | "before-user-turn", sourceMessageId },
cutTurnIndex? }`. The client resolves `N` to the turn's YA message id from
its own turn index; the server resolves the real human-turn boundary from
the transcript exactly as the fork route does (provider ids stay
server-side), then:

1. Rejects (`409`) when the session is `in-turn`, `waiting-input`, or
   compacting, when a live queued or steered message is pending, or when the
   cut is not a completed human-turn boundary. The client never substitutes
   a partial boundary.
2. Records a **rewind record** in session metadata before touching the
   provider: `{ id, at, cutMessageId, droppedFromMessageId, droppedTurnCount,
   reason: "clear" | "clearloop" (+ loop id and iteration) }`. It is a
   display object: never model context, survives restart and device change.
3. Stops the live process, if any, and arms the record as the session's
   **pending rewind**. Claude's truncation is a resume option, so the rewind
   takes effect when the next process for the session launches, whichever
   path launches it: the `/resume` route, the `/clearloop` sender, Project
   Queue dispatch, a heartbeat or wake turn, reactivate, or a settings
   restart. The supervisor resolves the truncation at that one seam
   (`resolveResumeTruncation`): a pending rewind passes
   `resumeSessionAt = cutMessageId` and wins over any caller-supplied
   truncation (the API-error tail cut), and the record stops being pending
   once the process has started. A route never consumes it itself, so no
   launch path can replay a tail the view shows as dropped. When exactly one
   turn is dropped, `resumeDropsTurn` names that turn's prompt UUID so the
   CLI refuses if the discarded range holds anything the user's view had not
   seen (an absorbed queued message, a task notification). The SDK validates
   only a single declared turn, so a multi-turn drop passes no
   `resumeDropsTurn`. A refusal is deterministic and is never retried: it
   arrives as an `error_during_execution` result whose text starts with
   `Resume rejected by --resume-drops-turn:`; the supervisor deletes that
   rewind record, emits the metadata event with `rewindRecordRemoved`, every
   open view reloads the transcript (the grouped rows are live again), a
   running clearloop ends as `interrupted`, and the next send resumes the
   full chain.
4. Returns the record (`null` when the cut was already the tail, a no-op)
   and whether a process was stopped. The session metadata event carries
   the record (`rewindRecord`); every open view of the session applies it
   to its loaded transcript in place (rows after the cut join the group
   behind the synthetic header), and refetches only when the cut lies
   outside its loaded window. **The in-place application must produce what a
   reload produces**: it follows the same membership, nesting, and header
   placement rules as the reader below, so a watching tab and a tab opened
   afterwards show the same outline, and no reload is needed to correct one.
   In particular the header goes immediately before the first row this
   record claims, not immediately after the cut, so earlier groups at the
   same cut keep their place ahead of it. The tab that issued the rewind applies it
   from the response before the event arrives. The detail response carries
   `rewindRecordIds`, the ids of the records its projection applied; a tab
   returning to the session with a cached transcript compares them and
   reloads whole when they differ, since an incremental catch-up can only
   append rows, never regroup older ones.

**Forks and clones.** The SDK fork copies file lines positionally and
remaps every uuid, so rewind records cannot travel with a fork. A fork or
clone whose slice point is at or before a cut excludes the dropped rows
outright; one sliced at a later live turn carries them as a dead branch the
reader hides. A full copy taken while a rewind is still pending (no turn yet
written past the cut) is sliced at the cut, so the child is exactly the kept
prefix rather than a session whose tip is the dropped tail. The legacy
`/clone` route copies the transcript verbatim with its uuids, so it copies
`rewindRecords` and any pending rewind to the child instead.

**Idle reaps are not stops.** An idle reap tears down a quiet process for
want of viewers and reports `session-aborted` with `reason: "idle-reap"`;
a clearloop waiting out its inactivity window ignores it and its next send
starts a fresh process as it would have anyway.

The rewind changes only the conversation. Files, worktree state, and
provider-side file checkpoints are untouched; a code-restoring rewind is the
separate [fork with worktree checkpoint](../gaps/sketches/fork-with-worktree-checkpoint.md)
story.

## Durable history: the rewound group

YA's session view must not lose rewound turns. The Claude reader today hides
a deliberate rewind branch (the active branch continues through a user row)
per [claude](claude.md) § Transcript Structure. With rewind records as an
input, the reader instead emits the dropped rows as a **rewound group**:

- Group membership is positional: every row after the cut's line in file
  order that was written before the record's `at` and not already claimed by
  an earlier rewind (a row keeps its first claim). Rows the session writes
  after the rewind are the live branch and are never grouped, even before
  the next turn exists (the record, not tip selection, decides the cut;
  until a new turn is written the displayed tail is the cut itself).
  Positional membership means a compaction inside a cleared span cannot
  split it and clock skew between transcript and server cannot move rows.
- Membership is by position, not by whether the provider stamped the row with
  a uuid. A queued message delivered into a cleared iteration is a transcript
  row with no uuid, and it joins that iteration's group; leaving it live
  would scatter delivered queued messages through the collapsed history as
  though they were still in the conversation, and would count them as live
  turns — for the tail window, and for the next rewind's `droppedTurnCount`
  and `droppedFromMessageId`, which grow without bound across a long loop
  when the previous iterations' queued messages never leave the live branch.
  A durable receipt merged into the middle of a
  cleared span — a `/goal` or clearloop notice whose timestamp lands there —
  joins the group of the row before it, for the same reason.
- **Nesting.** A group nests exactly when its own cut is a row that some
  other rewind dropped. A clear whose cut is earlier than an existing group's
  cut therefore encloses that group: the new block claims the unclaimed rows
  after its cut, the older block's cut row among them, the older block sits
  inside it unchanged, and it renders nested, collapsed under the outer
  header and expandable on its own once the outer block is open
  (`rewoundParentGroupId` on the inner header and rows). Repeated rewinds to
  one still-live cut — every `/clearloop` iteration — are **siblings**: none
  of them drops the shared cut, so each stays its own top-level collapsed
  entry in iteration order rather than vanishing inside the newest one.
- A tail window never starts inside a group: when the window boundary
  lands on a grouped row, it backs up to that group's header.
- Placement: at the cut, in transcript order, before any later live rows.
- Presentation: one collapsed outline entry by default. Expanding shows the
  dropped turns with their ordinary rendering, styled as nested rows (the
  `subagent-item` presentation). The main session view is required; the
  sidebar's nested rendering of the same group is optional and not built.
  The dropped-turn count is in the header's tooltip. A clearloop
  iteration's header also offers a copy control that yields the `/clearloop`
  command for the iterations still to run after that one
  (`/clearloop N (M−m): prompt`), so a loop can be relaunched from history.
- The header reads as the command that produced the group: `/clear N`, or
  `/clear N [#m/M: prompt]` for a clearloop iteration. It carries a boxed
  `+`/`−` marker; expanded rows hang off a vertical bar beneath it. Toggling
  keeps the header fixed under the pointer (the list never jumps to the
  tail), and works the same with Conversation view on or off, where the
  expanded rows are projected like any other rows.
- **Margin navigation.** A click on a row's margin (the row itself, not its
  content or a control) scrolls so the next row at the same outline level
  lands just under the pointer; right-click goes to the previous one. A
  further click without moving the mouse steps again. Outline levels are the
  top level and each rewound group.
- Every rewind produces its own group, so M clearloop iterations leave M
  reviewable groups at the same cut, in order.
- The header row carries the cut row's timestamp, not the rewind time:
  timeline entries are ordered by their latest row time, and a later time on
  the header would drag the cut's turn past the group's own rows. The rewind
  time is kept in the header's `rewoundGroup.at`.

- Search, copy, and turn navigation treat grouped rows as history: they are
  reachable when expanded and never counted as turns for `N`.

**Composer recall.** `/clear N`, `/fork N`, and `/clearloop …` never become
transcript turns, so accepted commands are recorded per session in browser
storage and merged ahead of the turn history in the recall drawer
(Ctrl+Up). A command that fails to parse is put back into the composer
instead of being discarded. Harness-injected user rows such as task
notifications are never offered for recall.

## `/clearloop`

A clearloop is a **server-owned job** persisted in session metadata
(`{ id, cutMessageId, cutTurnIndex, prompt, total: M, completed: m,
state: "running" | "completed" | "cancelled" | "interrupted", startedAt,
endedAt }`). The requesting tab may disconnect; the loop continues.

**Iteration.** Rewind to the cut (the first iteration is a no-op rewind when
the cut is already the tail), then send the prompt as an ordinary direct
turn. The iteration ends when the session has been **inactive for the
inactivity window**: no user send and no assistant progress for that long,
where progress is any provider message or raw provider event and the session
is idle or waiting for input at the end of the window. Then `m` increments;
if `m < M` the next iteration starts, else the loop completes.

**Why inactivity, not turn counting.** A strict "one assistant turn plus its
blocking question and answer" boundary requires YA to classify every user
send as a question answer or a manual turn. The inactivity boundary needs no
classification and behaves obviously with the rest of the queue: a patient
queued message lands when the session is quiet, a steer lands during work,
and both simply reset the window. They are part of the iteration, and the
next rewind discards them into that iteration's rewound group along with
everything else after the cut. The strict variant remains a candidate behind
the same boundary seam; v1 ships inactivity only.

**Inactivity window setting.** One server-wide value,
`clearloopInactivitySeconds`, in the **Message delivery** settings
category, titled "/clearloop Inactivity Window", default 60, range 10 s to
1 h. It has a slider and a text field accepting a number with an `s`, `m`,
or `h` suffix (`45s`, `2m`, `1h`; a bare number is seconds), rounded to
whole seconds and clamped to the range, and displayed in the same form. It
is server-definitive because the server runs the timer. A running loop reads
the current value at each boundary.

**Queue rail entry.** While a loop is running, the canonical queued-message
projection carries one entry `kind: "ya-command", yaCommand: "clearloop"`
with the prompt, `m/M`, and state. Once the server observes inactivity the
entry also carries the quiet anchor (`quietSince`) and the window; the
client counts down to the next rewind once a second from that anchor
locally, with no per-second server traffic. The server republishes the
entry whenever it re-checks (every 5 s while the provider is busy, once when
quiet), so a moved anchor corrects the countdown within that lag. The loop
itself runs on the server and does not depend on any client viewing the
session. It renders through the existing chip
surface with a **m/M badge**, is always ordered last in the rail, and its
tooltip shows the full prompt. It never occupies a deferred, patient, or
provider delivery position, exposes no Steer or edit action, and no queued
send is ever admitted through the patient or deferred lane to start an
iteration: the loop sends its prompt directly at the boundary it owns.
Because the projection is server-owned, the badge is identical on every
tab and survives reloads.

**Remaining-count badge.** While a loop runs, the session's sidebar row, its
title in the session header, and its process card in the Agents view show
a green badge with the remaining iteration count. It rides the session
summaries and process list as a small `clearloop` object (remaining, total,
cut turn, prompt, window) and the session metadata change event, so it
updates live and clears when the loop ends. Its tooltip states the
contract: Stop or a server reload aborts the loop; otherwise the window of
inactivity rewinds to `/clear N` and relaunches the prompt. The header
title lays out as a flex row so the badge survives a long ellipsized title.

**Patience.** A loop is *impatient* by default: the inactivity window alone
decides when the next rewind happens. A *patient* loop additionally waits for
the [project idle predicate](project-queue.md#project-idle-predicate) — the
same predicate Project Queue uses, minus its readiness check, because that
check is only refreshed while Project Queue has backlog. Blockers naming the
loop's own session are dropped: that session's quiescence is what the
inactivity window already measured, so counting it would hold the loop
against itself. While a patient loop is held, the queue-rail entry reports the
raw blockers in place of the countdown, and it re-asks every five seconds.
A server with no Project Queue cannot report project idleness; it refuses to
make a loop patient rather than silently running it impatiently.

A loop starts patient when the command itself arrived through a patient lane —
a `/clearloop` delivered by Project Queue (§ Queued YA commands in
[project-queue](project-queue.md)) — and impatient otherwise. Patience is also
a runtime control on the remaining-count badge; changing it lands at the next
boundary and never disturbs the iteration already running.

**Remaining-count badge menu.** Right-click, long-press, or the context-menu
key on the session header's badge opens Stop, the patience toggle (Patient /
Impatient), and Start now. Start now ends the current iteration immediately,
skipping both the remaining inactivity window and any project wait; it refuses
while the loop is already starting an iteration, rather than overlapping
itself. A left click still cancels, as before. The badge is green while
impatient and Project Queue purple while patient, so the wait the loop is in
is legible without opening the menu. The sidebar and Agents chips stay
passive and carry the same color.

**Settings changes take effect on the next iteration.** Before a rewind
stops the live process it persists that process's current effort, thinking,
model, and permission mode as the session's launch settings, so the resume
that sends the next prompt (a clearloop iteration or the user's next send)
uses what was last applied mid-session rather than the original launch
values.

**The loop's own rewind is not a stop.** Rewinding aborts the live process
to arm the truncating resume, which raises the same abort signal as a kill.
The service ignores that signal while its own rewind is in flight; only a
stop it did not request interrupts the loop. A requested turn stop is a
separate signal that the rewind never raises, so it ends the loop whenever
it arrives.

**Stopping.**

- The entry's **x / cancel** control cancels the loop **without** stopping
  in-flight assistant work and **without** starting a turn: the current
  iteration is left to finish on its own, no further rewind happens, and the
  loop state becomes `cancelled`.
- The session **stop** button (abort) interrupts the provider as usual and
  also ends the loop as `interrupted`.
- Ordinary sends do not stop the loop (see the inactivity rationale). A user
  who wants to keep the current iteration's result cancels the loop before
  the window elapses.
- A rewind refusal or provider failure ends the loop as `interrupted` with
  the error.
- A server restart during a running loop marks it `interrupted` at the next
  startup (with the durable notice); YA never resumes a loop on startup.
- The remaining-count chip in the session header is also the cancel control:
  clicking it (after a confirmation) cancels like the queue entry's x, so the
  current turn finishes and no further rewind happens. Its context menu's Stop
  entry does the same. The sidebar and Agents chips are passive. Every chip's
  tooltip states the contract.

**Durable notice.** Every terminal state writes a durable notice into the
session at the tail (a `local_command` display row, like goal receipts):
the original `/clearloop N M: <prompt>` line, `completed m of M`, and for
`cancelled`/`interrupted` the remaining `M−m`. The notice is session
history, not a toast, and is never model context.

## Defaults and compatibility

- The commands are explicitly invoked transforms and need no option
  ([vanilla-defaults](vanilla-defaults.md)). The two menu entries are added
  inside the existing hover menu on rewind-capable providers; the rewound
  group is collapsed by default so the default view reads like the
  provider's own rewound timeline. Authorized by graehl on 2026-09-18 in the
  originating request.
- `session-rewind` is a permanent, version-implied server capability,
  **ID 78**, introduced after 0.8.2, gating the rewind route, the clearloop
  routes (including the `PATCH` patience/Start-now route), the `clearloop`
  queued-entry kind, the `yaCommand` field on Project Queue items, and the
  rewind records in metadata. Those were all added before the capability
  reached a stable release, so they extend ID 78 rather than allocating a new
  one. The optional-feature horizon on 2026-09-18 is v0.8.0 and
  v0.8.1 (the latest two stable releases and all releases from the
  preceding 14 days); neither has any of these. Without the capability the
  client hides the menu entries, marks the commands unavailable, makes no
  rewind or clearloop request, and ignores unknown queue kinds and metadata
  fields. No existing capability meaning changes; existing fork behavior is
  unchanged. The originating request approved this gate.
- Providers: Claude, Claude Gateway, and Claude Ollama sessions. Others
  report rewind unsupported; the route returns `409` and the client hides
  the surface. This Claude-only placement is the accepted first revision
  (graehl, 2026-09-18). Codex supports the same verb through
  `thread/revert {threadId, beforeTurnId}`, which keeps the thread id and so
  the prompt-cache key; the generated protocol carries `ThreadRevertParams`,
  `ThreadRevertResponse`, and `ThreadRevertedNotification` as of 2026-09-19
  (graehl approved the refresh). A fork-based Codex rewind is ruled out: the
  Quick Answer measurements show a Codex fork child starts 94% uncached, so
  the feature stays disabled on Codex until the in-place verb is wired
  (between turns, on an idle thread, with the thread re-read afterwards) and
  its cache effect measured. Pi has a more general tree operation (`/tree`)
  that could back it. Neither changes the command vocabulary or the
  rewound-group presentation.

## Future work: continuing from any node

The positional model supports the well-defined tree operation of continuing
from any turn, including one inside a cleared span (Claude's truncating
resume accepts any chain entry). It is deliberately not exposed yet:
`/clear N` on a cleared turn is refused with a message, because the UI is
unspecified. The naive display would leave the new parent and its ancestors
hidden inside the collapsed block they belong to, so the part of history now
back in the assistant's context would not be re-exposed; that is acceptable
for a first version only with a warning banner saying so. Selecting the
target belongs in an interactive `/tree` picker (as Pi's `/tree`), with a
dotted path notation for addressing nodes. The reader's active-branch
selection also needs a rule for a live branch whose ancestors are grouped.

## Tests that should fail on contract regressions

- `/clear N` on an idle Claude session restarts the process with
  `resumeSessionAt` equal to the last chain entry of turn N, records the
  rewind, and the next transcript read shows turns `1..N` live plus one
  collapsed group holding the dropped turns; the group persists across a
  metadata reload.
- `/clear N` during `in-turn` or with a pending queued message is refused
  with `409` and records nothing.
- A single-turn drop passes `resumeDropsTurn`; a multi-turn drop does not,
  and a discarded range containing a non-turn row is refused by YA.
- `/clearloop 3 2: p` and `/clear 3` then `/clearloop 2: p` produce the same
  rewind records and sends.
- A clearloop iteration ends only after the configured inactivity window
  elapses with no user send and no provider event; a steer or patient
  delivery inside the window resets it and is included in the next group.
- Cancel on the clearloop entry leaves the running provider turn alone,
  performs no further rewind, and writes the `completed m of M` notice.
- The clearloop entry never appears in deferred or patient positions and is
  ordered last.
- The inactivity setting rejects values outside 10–3600 seconds and parses
  `s`/`m`/`h` suffixes.
- Without `session-rewind`, the client shows no Clear menu entries and sends
  no rewind request for a typed `/clear N`.
- A pending rewind is applied by every Claude launch path, and it wins over
  a caller-supplied `resumeSessionAt`; a non-Claude provider or a new
  session gets no truncation (`resumeTruncation.test.ts`).
- A `Resume rejected by --resume-drops-turn:` result deletes the record and
  ends a running clearloop as `interrupted`; an idle-reap abort leaves the
  loop running (`ClearloopService.test.ts`).
- An unchanged transcript re-projects when its rewind record set changes,
  including when a record is deleted (`normalization.test.ts`).
- The tail window and `totalUserTurns` count live turns only; grouped rows
  ride along with their cut (`pagination.test.ts`).
- A queued message delivered inside a cleared span is grouped with it and
  keeps its delivery stamp, while a queued message delivered on the live
  branch stays live and in place (`claude-messages.test.ts`).
- Two rewinds to the same live cut produce two sibling groups in order, with
  no `rewoundParentGroupId` on either — on the server projection and on the
  client's in-place application alike (`claude-messages.test.ts`,
  `renderSelectors.test.ts`).
- A durable receipt whose timestamp lands inside a cleared span joins that
  group; one on the live branch does not (`goal-overlays.test.ts`).
