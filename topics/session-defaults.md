Topic: session-defaults

See also: [permission-mode](permission-mode.md) for the `Auto` permission-mode
fallback contract when a selected model cannot honor provider-decided approval.

## Contract

Session defaults are not one flat bucket. A default either answers "what should
new sessions generally do?" or "how should this provider/model spend work?".
Those scopes must stay separate in storage, UI grouping, and migration.

### All-provider defaults

All-provider defaults apply no matter which provider is selected. Provider
capabilities may decide whether a choice has an effect at launch. Except for a
security boundary whose current execution host cannot enforce, the UI should
not hide or rewrite the user's standing preference merely because the
currently selected provider lacks the feature.

- **Default AI provider** — the provider chosen when opening a new-session form.
  The floating composer's informational chip resolves this plus the provider's
  preferred model through `useDefaultNewSessionModel`, which must keep matching
  the New Session form's initial seeding (same `getProviderSessionDefaults` and
  preferred-model pick).
- **Permission mode** — the requested approval policy. A model may hide or
  ignore unsupported modes such as provider-decided `Auto`, but the saved
  default is not a provider/model economics choice.
- **Sandbox new sessions** — the default-off launch-time host-confinement
  toggle. The saved value is provider-independent and each New Session may
  override it before process creation. The control is rendered and sent only
  when the server reports a currently available host backend; see
  [session-sandboxing](session-sandboxing.md). Selecting it also selects the
  subordinate **Network firewall** default, which preserves public IPv4 egress
  while blocking the YA host and local networks. Explicit firewall opt-out is
  retained; an absent firewall value defaults on only inside a project-write
  sandbox. See
  [session-sandbox-network-boundary](session-sandbox-network-boundary.md).
- **Recaps** — recap mode and away threshold belong together. They are standing
  session-helper choices, not properties of whichever provider button happens
  to be selected. In New Session's linear control stack, they follow the core
  launch choices so an infrequently changed helper does not sit next to the
  composer.
- **Prompt suggestions** — expose `Off` / `Native` unconditionally. Launch code
  only enables native provider suggestions when supported, but the default UI
  must not show provider-specific "unsupported" copy in the all-provider area.
- **Show thinking** — display policy for already-produced thinking rows. This
  is not provider spend; it belongs outside the AI-provider-specific region and
  may keep the existing per-install/live-toggle persistence pattern.
- **Forked sessions** — fork-after-summary display/opening behavior, such as
  whether to open the forked session in a new tab when ready. This is a
  session-UI preference, not a provider/model economics choice.

### Provider-specific defaults

Provider-specific defaults depend on provider/model capabilities, cost, latency,
and naming. They must be keyed by provider, and model-sensitive values should be
resolved against that provider's available model metadata.

- **Model** — model ids are provider-local and cannot be shared across providers.
- **Service tier / speed tier** — provider-visible economics and latency knobs.
- **Thinking mode** — `off` / `auto` / `on` changes provider work requested.
- **Effort level** — effort labels are not comparable across providers; `high`
  on one backend is not a portable meaning or cost on another.
- **Tailed Recap Model** — tailed recap model ids, costs, and availability are
  provider-local. The selector is intentionally lower-priority than thinking
  mode and effort. OpenAI-compatible helper targets stay hidden until
  [openai-compatible-helper-sessions](openai-compatible-helper-sessions.md)
  exists.

Switching AI Provider should restore that provider's provider-specific defaults
without disturbing all-provider defaults. Changing an all-provider default should
not overwrite per-provider model/thinking/effort choices.

### Provider catalog readiness

The first authenticated or remotely connected YA visit in a browser tab primes
provider status and model catalogs through the same source-scoped request/cache
used by New Session, settings, and restart surfaces. A consumer mounted during
that primer joins its in-flight request rather than repeating provider probes.
Catalogs and in-flight work from one local or remote host never satisfy a
consumer viewing another host. Primer failure remains advisory: the first
consumer retries through its normal loading/error path.

Readiness is client-presence-driven. YA does not periodically probe provider
catalogs while no browser is visiting it. The standing provider/model choice is
durable settings state, not a dynamic catalog answer: New Session renders the
exact saved provider and provider-local model in its final control region, then
revalidates installation, authentication, alternatives, and capabilities in
place. An unselected provider's discovery does not delay or clear that choice.

The dynamic catalog keeps the existing two request shapes:

- `GET /api/providers` returns the exposed provider-card collection and remains
  the complete-response compatibility path.
- `GET /api/providers/:name` resolves and refreshes one selected provider without
  probing unrelated providers.

The server retains provider rows through one byte-bounded,
source-versioned owner. Ordinary callers join current work, concurrent forced
callers coalesce, forced work supersedes older ordinary work, and late old
success or failure cannot replace or delete the newer row. The provider's model
catalog key participates in generation identity. Aggregate `Promise.all`
failure behavior is unchanged.

The client persists a versioned, source-scoped browser snapshot for seven days.
An explicit allowlist retains provider/model display metadata and capabilities;
identity, expiry, login commands, credentials, authorization material, raw
provider output, and unknown configuration are excluded. Hydration marks the
snapshot expired immediately: it is an opening guess, never a probe result.
Consumers still report loading, the rendered group stays busy, and current
server rows replace the snapshot in place. Aggregate and named rows share one
request-admission sequence and publish accepted responses to every mounted
source consumer: a later aggregate settings reload supersedes an older named
cache entry, while a late older aggregate cannot displace newer named facts or
reintroduce an old error.

Display validity and launch authority are separate. A stale selected row may
remain visible while a named probe is pending or failed. Claude Gateway starts
a forced named probe after the selection becomes current; Start and Project
Queue launch remain blocked until that successful response advertises the
required model. Actual new-session process creation repeats the Gateway-only
advertised-model check, so deferred Project Queue and internal worker-queue
launches cannot reuse enqueue-time authority. A Project Queue item held by the
worker queue remains in durable `dispatching` state until launch starts; a
validation failure moves it to `failed` with the catalog error rather than
removing its prompt. At worker capacity, a direct Gateway caller without that
durable failure channel receives the existing `queue_full` response instead of
a queued acceptance whose later failure would discard its prompt. Retry
refreshes Gateway alone. Other providers retain ordinary five-minute row reuse
and exact unlisted model-id behavior.

For ordinary local providers, `installed` is the New Session selection and
launch gate: it means YA has a runtime to start. `authenticated` is a separate
readiness signal and does not disable that launch attempt, because a harness may
discover, refresh, or request credentials only after startup. New Session marks
the selection as needing authentication and lets the real provider startup
either succeed or return the actionable authentication error. A coarse desktop
`applicationDetected` signal alone never authorizes launch. Claude Gateway's
current-catalog rule above remains the narrower exception.

New Session's initial subscription-usage read is admitted as supplementary
startup work after earlier route tiers. Direct-demand usage consumers and every
explicit Refresh remain immediate.

There is no persisted server provider/model snapshot, so a clean browser on a
fresh server still awaits the aggregate for provider cards. Generic Gateway
model discovery can still start its configured runtime, and aggregate failure
is not isolated by row. The measured aggregate median crosses the threshold for
reconsidering descriptor/model-refresh separation; those wire changes still
require the compatibility review in
[`docs/tactical/094-new-session-provider-catalog-readiness.md`](../docs/tactical/094-new-session-provider-catalog-readiness.md).

## Recap fallback semantics

`Forked` is a preference for the higher-fidelity recap path. **Tailed Recap
Model** is the provider-scoped helper model for the tailed path, so it is shown
with provider-specific defaults when `Tailed` is selected and hidden for `Off`,
`Native`, and `Forked`.

`Native` remains a valid internal/future recap mode, but no current backend
offers a meaningful way to request native recaps. Do not show it in the UI until
a provider capability makes it real.

## Per-session live picks vs global defaults

The rest of this doc is about *defaults that seed a new session*. A separate
concern is what happens when a user changes model/effort/thinking **inside an
existing session** and then reloads or the server process is torn down: the live
pick must survive as a server-owned per-session choice, not silently reset or
depend on one browser's storage.

`SessionMetadata.effectiveLaunchSettings` stores the last successfully applied
permission mode, exact requested-model token, service tier, thinking mode, and
effort with a session-local monotonic revision. A process lifetime is not a
settings lifetime: every replacement process for an existing session starts
from that record. A replacement process resolves an explicit validated request
first, then this complete durable record (including intentional null/provider-
default values), then applicable pre-snapshot evidence, and finally the
conservative server/provider default. Existing YA requested-model metadata
precedes provider transcript inference because it records the user's exact YA
selection token.

For a Codex session that predates the complete snapshot, the first later cold
launch lazily reads the latest valid transcript `turn_context`. Its non-empty
model and supported effort are recoverable. `none` recovers disabled thinking;
a supported named effort recovers adaptive summarized thinking with that
effort. Exact `never` plus danger-full-access recovers Bypass, and exact
`on-request` plus read-only recovers Plan. Ask and Accept Edits both produce
`on-request` plus workspace-write, so that pair and every incomplete or unknown
pair recover as conservative Ask. Legacy absence or ambiguity never grants
Bypass. Unsupported/absent effort remains unknown rather than being coerced.

Recovery is read-only until process launch succeeds. The complete effective
settings actually used by a successful launch then become authoritative and
are written as revision 1 through the ordinary snapshot path; failure or
cancellation writes nothing, and later cold launches use the snapshot instead
of reinterpreting the transcript. Merely listing, rendering, scanning, or
indexing old sessions does not migrate them.

A live configuration response is successful only after the provider applies
the selection and the metadata writer flushes a snapshot containing it.
Explicit reactivation metadata changes for provider, executor, recap, prompt
suggestion, and sandbox selection flush in that same serialized transaction.
If a write fails, YA retains the actual live state as pending and retries it
without repeating an already-applied provider change.

Browser-local permission/model state remains useful for immediate stopped-row
presentation and compatibility with older servers, while global thinking and
effort values remain defaults for new or legacy sessions. Once Activate owns a
process, the existing process-info request and live stream are authoritative;
the composer and model panel adopt that process's restored configuration. An
older server that omits newer state therefore retains its established fallback
instead of causing the client to clear durable server state.

An effort selection accepted while a turn is active is authoritative pending
state: process info reports the selected next-turn effort so a browser refresh
does not replace it with the last provider-observed value. The durable launch
snapshot continues to report the last applied effort until the provider reaches
the idle boundary and accepts the pending selection.

**Show thinking** remains a browser display preference. It is deliberately not
part of the provider launch snapshot and does not move with a session.

## UI placement

The session-defaults settings panel follows the launch decision order through
sandboxing, then uses the wider explanatory layout efficiently: AI Provider,
model, thinking/effort, permission mode, sandboxing, a paired **Show thinking**
and **Suggestions** row, recaps, and the conditional **Tailed Recap Model**.
**Show thinking** and **Suggestions** share the available row on a wide panel
and stack on a narrow panel; recaps retain their full-width row. A **Related
behavior** divider follows that core launch sequence; fork-opening, compaction,
and prompt-cache keepalive controls live below it. The visible order is for
comprehension and does not change persistence scope: provider/model economics
remain provider-specific, while permission, sandbox, recap, suggestions,
show-thinking, and fork-opening keep their established all-provider or
client-local ownership.

When recap mode is enabled, its away-duration control occupies a full-width row
attached to the recap choices and before the conditional helper model. The
slider, numeric seconds input, and unit remain visible as one control and never
share or overlap the paired Show thinking / Suggestions grid row.

New Session instead prioritizes the choices most likely to change before a
launch. On a narrow viewport its visual and focus order is composer, project,
AI Provider/model/thinking/permission, then the lower-frequency show-thinking,
recap, conditional **Tailed Recap Model**, prompt-suggestion, and sandbox
controls. On a wide viewport the project chooser sits beside the composer, the
primary launch controls continue below the composer, and those lower-frequency
controls use the column beneath the closed project chooser. Expanding the
project chooser temporarily hides the secondary controls so its overlaid,
scrollable project history remains unobstructed; closing it restores them.
DOM, visual, keyboard, and screen-reader traversal retain the same row-major
order while the chooser is closed. Placement does not change a setting's
all-provider or provider-local persistence scope.

New Session starts in its compact, routine-use presentation: explanatory
captions are hidden, while desktop hover tooltips expose the same text. A small
`?` button on the option region reveals the full captions, primarily for touch
screens where hover is unavailable; the expansion is form-local and is not a
new persisted default. Settings always shows captions because explanation and
searchability matter more there than fitting the launch form on one screen.

Both surfaces take each control's base title and description, plus optional
Settings-only search terms and label overrides, from one declarative control
copy definition. A description that depends on the selected value, such as the
active recap or suggestion mode, stays beside that live value but must appear
both as compact-mode tooltip text and as expanded caption text.

Permission-mode cards are equal-sized by design. Their captions should fit the
card grid with short explanatory text:

- `Ask` — `Ask every time`
- `Edit` — `Ask to run commands`
- `Plan` — `Do not attempt edits`
- `Bypass` — `Auto-approve all actions`
- `Auto` — `Provider decides`

## Storage and migration direction

Use a shape that preserves existing top-level fields while adding a scoped
provider-default map, for example:

```ts
interface NewSessionDefaults {
  provider?: ProviderName;
  permissionMode?: PermissionMode;
  sandboxLevel?: SessionSandboxLevel;
  recapMode?: RecapMode;
  recapAfterSeconds?: number;
  promptSuggestionMode?: PromptSuggestionMode;
  providers?: Partial<Record<ProviderName, ProviderSessionDefaults>>;
}

interface ProviderSessionDefaults {
  model?: string;
  serviceTier?: string;
  thinkingMode?: ThinkingMode;
  effortLevel?: EffortLevel;
  helperSideModel?: string;
}
```

Backward compatibility rule: top-level legacy `model` / service-tier-like
fields, and legacy `useModelSettings` thinking/effort values, seed the selected
provider's first provider-specific entry. Do not discard configured values on
read; normalize into the scoped shape on the next save.

## Implementation plan

Session sandboxing follows the separate backend-integration gate in
[session-sandboxing](session-sandboxing.md); it is not part of the
UI/storage sequence below.

1. **Pin this contract.** Create this topic, add the glossary/topic index row,
   and use it as the commit topic for the UI/storage changes.
2. **Recap UI.** Group recap controls with all-provider defaults in the settings
   panel; keep **Tailed Recap Model** provider-specific; make `Forked` available
   whenever the provider can generate recaps.
3. **Prompt suggestions.** Show `Off` / `Native` unconditionally in the
   all-provider defaults area; remove provider-specific unsupported copy; keep
   launch-time native enablement capability-gated.
4. **Provider-specific defaults.** Add `newSessionDefaults.providers` and wire
   selected-provider model, thinking mode, effort, and tailed recap model
   through it. Preserve legacy fields and existing saved preferences by seeding
   the selected provider on read/next save.
5. **All-provider placement.** Keep permission mode, show-thinking display
   policy, and forked-session behavior outside provider-scoped persistence.
   Session Defaults and New Session may interleave these controls with
   provider-specific choices by launch relevance without changing their
   storage scope.
6. **Permission captions.** Shorten equal-width permission-mode card captions to
   the text above.
7. **Tests.** Cover provider switch persistence, all-provider recap/suggestion
   persistence, fork-to-tailed fallback, and the new ordering/label invariants in
   focused client/server tests before typecheck.
8. **Layout verification.** Verify the defaults panel is efficient and sensible
   in a modest 1200×1000 options content area: the core defaults should be
   usable without unnecessary scrolling, with recap/suggestion/provider/model/
   thinking/permission controls packed by their scope rather than stretched into
   a long vertical list.
