Topic: ui-testing

## Principle

By default, a request that changes what the client renders — a UI tweak,
layout or spacing fix, control/toolbar placement, grouping, or interaction
semantics — is **done** only after real browser screenshots of the final result
are captured at desktop and phone widths, inspected by the agent against the
request, and archived where a human can review them. In-progress captures are
optional while implementing (worthwhile at milestones); final-result captures
are required when visual verification remains agent-owned.

Inspection is the point: open each capture and check spacing, flow,
and control placement against the request — "route loaded, nav
visible" is not enough. Captures exist to catch the agent's own wrong
spatial/aesthetic guess; models routinely one-shot UI that is
functional but mis-spaced with misplaced controls (instituted
2026-07-26 after a commit-browser build landed exactly that way).

## User-owned visual verification

The user may explicitly take ownership of visual verification for a request or
a stated iteration series. Phrases such as "I will check it," "no screenshots,"
or "skip visual validation" are an intentional handoff, not a conflict with
this topic.

When the user makes that handoff:

1. Do not capture screenshots or launch a browser solely for visual QA.
2. Continue relevant nonvisual checks such as lint, typecheck, and focused
   automated tests unless the user also changes that scope.
3. Do not infer or report that the result was visually confirmed by the agent.
   State in the final response that visual verification was left to the user.
4. Do not wait for the user to report back before handing off the implemented
   change; their explicit acceptance of the visual check completes the agent's
   visual-QA responsibility.

Apply the handoff only to the scope the user stated. A handoff for an iteration
series may persist across its related tweaks, but do not silently carry it into
an unrelated request or a new session. Conversely, do not infer a handoff from
the user's presence, response speed, device, or presumed access to a live
build. When there is no explicit handoff, use the default capture workflow.

## Browser-first check protocol

1. Confirm that the user has not handed visual verification off to themselves.
   If they have, use the user-owned workflow above and stop this protocol.
2. Start the app UI and reproduce the target path in a real browser.
3. Navigate to the affected view (page, panel, or control).
4. Take screenshots at:
   - desktop width `1920x1080`,
   - narrow mobile width (`375x812` or equivalent).
5. Visually inspect each screenshot and confirm:
   - the requested change is present and correctly placed,
   - control rows and their descriptive text are grouped together,
   - active control state is visually clear,
   - no element overflows, crowds its row, or wastes obvious space.
6. Archive reviewed screenshots under a readable path (for example,
   `.artifacts/ui-testing/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<topic>/...`), and cite the
   file names in the final response (and the task note when one
   exists).
7. Leave a short reviewer note about what changed and what was
   visually confirmed.

## Recommended automation

Use the browser control tool listed in `CLAUDE.md` when it has an
available backend. If setup or discovery reports no browser, or the
browser inventory is empty, immediately fall back to the repository's
installed Playwright command:

```bash
ARTIFACT_DIR=".artifacts/ui-testing/$(date +%F)-topic"
mkdir -p "$ARTIFACT_DIR"
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec playwright screenshot \
  --ignore-https-errors \
  --block-service-workers \
  --wait-for-timeout 500 \
  --viewport-size "1920,1080" \
  https://localhost:3400/ \
  "$ARTIFACT_DIR/desktop.png"
pnpm --filter @yep-anywhere/client exec playwright screenshot \
  --ignore-https-errors \
  --block-service-workers \
  --wait-for-timeout 500 \
  --viewport-size "375,812" \
  https://localhost:3400/ \
  "$ARTIFACT_DIR/mobile.png"
```

For multi-step flows, add or run a focused `@playwright/test` case under
`packages/client/e2e/`. If Playwright itself is unavailable, use another
browser automation path or a manual browser session:

1. Open the target page directly in a browser.
2. Resize viewport to desktop + mobile dimensions.
3. Capture screenshots via the tool or OS-level capture.
4. Attach the files where reviewers can review them directly.

## Verification acceptance checklist

Complete either the agent-owned or user-owned branch.

### Agent-owned visual verification

- [ ] The requested change is visible and correctly placed in both
      captures.
- [ ] A single logical setting row does not span a control row and its
      status/explanation.
- [ ] A setting change has a matching explanatory text line directly
      below the control row.
- [ ] Preset buttons remain clickable and clearly indicate the current
      selection.
- [ ] Layout works at the mobile width without horizontal overflow.
- [ ] Screenshots at 1920×1080 and a phone width were captured,
      inspected by the agent, and cited for human review.

### User-owned visual verification

- [ ] The user explicitly took ownership of the visual check or asked
      to skip screenshots or visual validation.
- [ ] No browser or screenshot work was performed solely for visual QA.
- [ ] Relevant nonvisual verification still ran unless separately waived.
- [ ] The final response identifies visual verification as user-owned
      and does not claim independent visual confirmation.
